 3M Science Does Its Part to Eliminate a Source of Lead Contamination
 Our wheel weights are made from a non-lead composite material. According to the EPA, approximately 1.6 million pounds of lead wheel weights are lost in the United States when they fall off during normal driving conditions. These weights can enter the environment in a variety of ways, including being washed into storm sewers or gathered during street cleaning or disposed of in landfills. A growing number of jurisdictions are introducing and passing legislation that bans the use of lead wheel weights. Our lead-free, composite material provides a more environmentally friendly alternative without sacrificing performance. In addition to environmental benefits, these wheel weights also resist the corrosion that is common with lead weights, which enhances overall tire appearance.

 FOR USE ON plastic lenses – headlights, taillights, fog lights, directional lights and more
 3M abrasive technology removes yellowing and buildup without damaging plastic lens surface
 Easy to use – choose a kit with no tools required, or for use with a common household drill
 Save hundreds vs. replacing headlight lenses
 3M Headlight Lens Restoration Kit is a collection of professional-grade products assembled specifically for removing the cloudy, yellowed haze that builds up on automotive headlight lenses. Kits use a system of light abrasives to keep vehicles looking great and save money vs. replacing expensive lenses. They include complete directions, 3M Trizact sanding discs, pads and polishes.
 Kits contain masking tape, light sanding discs, wax protectant and more
 Restore Your Headlights Without Replacing Them
 Rather than using ineffective solvents — or spending big on new headlight lenses — you can choose our 3M Headlight Lens Restoration Kits. A complete system of light abrasives, polishes and protectants removes scratches, dirt and oxidization that can appear on your lenses, lowering your vehicle's value and reducing safe driving visibility. You can choose a kit that lets you restore headlight lenses without tools. Or, with just a spray water bottle and a common household drill, you can use the full kit with a complete range of abrasive discs for sanding, finishing and refining to remove discoloration that can cause your headlights, tail lights, fog and directional lights to appear cloudy and yellow — for a fraction of the cost and time of buying and installing new lenses. Each kit includes everything you need to restore two headlight lenses.
 How Does it Work?
 Our 3M Headlight Restoration Kit restores clear plastic lenses in a way that standard cleaners cannot. First, apply our high-performance masking tape to the painted surfaces around the lens you are restoring (some kits include 3M Automotive Masking Tape). Use our progressive system of Trizact abrasive discs to remove yellowing, scratches, dirt, haze, and other material buildup on the plastic lens. With or without a common household drill, our Hookit attachment system makes it easy — just slap the disc onto a pad, and you're ready to go. A choice of Headlight Restoration Kits features our 3M Scratch Remover or 3M Rubbing Compound to achieve maximum shine and clarity. Then, using a soft cloth, apply a light coating of 3M Synthetic Wax Protectant. Remove the masking tape, and you're finished.
 About Our Trizact Abrasives
 The abrasive in our Trizact abrasive discs for headlight restoration is so fine that you can sand across the plastic lenses without worrying about creating scratches or other damaging marks. 3M Trizact abrasives feature microreplication — small 3-dimensional structures are reproduced and then uniformly distributed over the surface of the disc. These patterned, precise mineral structures contain multiple layers of abrasive mineral. As the structures wear, fresh, sharp mineral is exposed. The result is that the abrasive cuts faster, stays sharper longer and allows for precise finish control — it removes the yellowing, dirt buildup and small scratches that can cause haze, without damaging the lens itself.
 Why Do You Need Headlight Restoration?
 Today's vehicles have a greater number of plastic components, from plastic headlight lenses to motorcycle windshields, plastic tail lights, trailer lights and more. Plastic components are great for durability and reducing overall weight, but they can yellow and haze with weather, sun and sand, limiting visibility and diminishing the appearance and value of the vehicle. While the impact on a vehicle's value varies, the dangers in terms of limited visibility are clear: It is a factor in 2.8 million accidents, 23,000 fatal crashes and 2,300 pedestrian deaths each year, according to the Motor Vehicle Lighting Council. Dim headlight bulbs and hazy plastic headlight lenses or surfaces may lead to this reduced visibility, putting you, your passengers and other cars at risk. The AAIA Car Care Council found that 26 percent of the cars it inspected had issues with their lighting system. Millions of cars on the road today have plastic headlight lenses. The problem increases with the age of the lens, and with the average age of cars on the road about 10 years old, the problem is growing. That is why it is important to correct hazy, dull headlights.",Medical gloves and accessories,42132200,Medical apparel and textiles,42130000,Medical Equipment and Accessories and Supplies,42000000

 Flexible backing flows over contoured surfaces for consistent finishing
 Three-dimensional design enables very consistent finishes throughout the abrasive life in robotic applications
 Ideal for intermediate finishing and fine polishing prior to plating or buffing
 Produces finer finishes than conventional electrostatically coated abrasives
 3M Trizact Cloth Belt 307EA uses our proprietary microreplication technology where micron-graded aluminum oxide particles are formed into tiny pyramids of abrasive mineral and then coated on a rayon backing. As these pyramids wear, fresh, sharp mineral is continually exposed to produce a consistent cut and a predictable, fine finish.
 Stainless steel finishing application
 Controlled Breakdown, Medium Pressure
 The abrasive and resin structure for the 3M Trizact Cloth Belt 307EA is formulated to break down under medium pressure and keep fresh, sharp mineral cutting to provide consistent finishes on hard metals such as carbon and stainless steel. The belt also features a grinding aid that helps prevent heat buildup, warping and discoloration.
 The belt is constructed on a durable cloth backing that helps provide control, conformability and effective medium-pressure grinding. The resin bonded abrasive gives you greater heat resistance and helps prevent delamination.
 Smooth Running, Fine Finish
 The belt uses a Film Media Splice, a strong secure bond joining the belt ends, consisting of a thin film-joining media that minimizes ""chatter marks,"" ensures a smooth running belt, and consistent finishing results. When compared to conventional abrasive products, proprietary Trizact abrasives produce a finer finish, achieve results faster, and last longer.
 As 3M Trizact ""pyramids"" wear, fresh abrasive mineral is constantly exposed to the workpiece, resulting in faster, more consistent cutting throughout the life of the belt.
 Ideal for Robotic Finishing and Polishing
 Robotic metal polishing demands the most consistent, refined cut and long abrasive life. 3M Trizact abrasives can consistently deliver near-mirror finishes while also delivering the abrasive life that helps reduce changeouts and downtime in robotic cells. This helps maximize the efficiency of the cell, allowing you to produce more parts per belt.
 The 3M Trizact Advantage
 Unlike conventional abrasives, our line of 3M Trizact belts start sharp and stay sharp, resulting in more predictable finishes and improved, consistent quality. 3M Trizact belts can last up to five times longer than conventional belts and provide precise finish control such that operators can reduce grade sequences, requiring fewer process steps and fewer abrasive products.
 Three-dimensional structures uniformly distributed over the entire surface of 3M Trizact abrasives ensure consistent performance and eliminate part to part variation.",Fibers,11151500,Fibers and threads and yarns,11150000,Mineral and Textile and Inedible Plant and Animal Materials,11000000

They come in a broad range of densities and grades to suit different metals, the degree of aggressiveness required, shape of the part, and desired finish. Although used for some of the same tasks as Standard Abrasives Buff and Blend products, they are designed with a far stronger and denser construction to support more aggressive applications and accomplish material removal more rapidly. Even though unitized wheels are much stiffer products, the non-woven nylon fibers of the wheel maintain the advantage of responding to surface irregularities while preserving the geometry of the piece, and produce a consistent finish.
 Unitized wheels are created by starting with layers of open web material that combines non-woven fiber strands and abrasive mineral with a tough resin bond. These layers of web are then cured and compressed together. By fusing layers of open web, the abrasive gains more toughness and durability, so it can withstand repeated wear.
 Ultimately, the wheel's durability is what makes it such a good match for edges. Regardless of the diameter or thickness of the wheel, it maintains its structural integrity to remain a stiff and long-lasting abrasive even under high pressure. Additionally, as the layers wear, the wheel can be dressed to maintain its shape.
 Load-Resistance Boosts Life and Performance
 Standard Abrasives Unitized Wheels are load-resistant to keep you cutting with fresh mineral. The gaps in the open web allow unwanted swarf to escape. Consequently, less debris clogs the abrasive, so the mineral can stay fresh, keep cutting sharp and deliver a consistent cut over the life of the product. As the fibers break down and fresh mineral is exposed, it reduces the likelihood of dull or blunt mineral smearing the surface, contributing to cleaner surfaces and less re-work. Furthermore, manual fatigue that may result from applying heavy pressure to a dull abrasive is reduced.
 The Many Benefits of Standard Abrasives Non-Woven Products

 Compatible with a Variety of Tools
 Unitized wheels are typically used on a die grinder. A benefit of unitized wheels is that they are bi-directional and can be mounted on a tool or pedestal grinder without regard to the direction of the spindle rotation. This means the Standard Abrasives Unitized Wheel can be used with a variety of tools, and regardless of which way the workpiece is fed through the machine, the wheel will be able to respond, giving operators more flexibility. The stiffness of the unitized construction enables operators to use thinner wheels to access awkward angles with grinding tools.
 Our Standard Abrasives Aluminum Oxide 700 Series Unitized Wheels come in a range of diameters from 1-6"" and require a unitized wheel mandrel (sold separately) for attachment to the tool or directly to the spindle of a pedestal grinder.. Quick change wheels are also available (sold separately).
 Deburring, finishing, blending, and fast stock removal on ferrous and nonferrous materials
 Non-Woven Unitized Construction Offers a Step Up in Density and Durability for Stubborn Surfaces
 Standard Abrasives Unitized Wheels are a great match for tough deburring, cleaning, blending and finishing applications. They come in a broad range of densities and grades to suit different metals, the degree of aggressiveness required, shape of the part, and desired finish. Although used for some of the same tasks as Standard Abrasives Buff and Blend products, they are designed with a far stronger and denser construction to support more aggressive applications and accomplish material removal more rapidly. Even though unitized wheels are much stiffer products, the non-woven nylon fibers of the wheel maintain the advantage of responding to surface irregularities while preserving the geometry of the piece, and produce a consistent finish.
 Unitized wheels are created by starting with layers of open web material that combines non-woven fiber strands and abrasive mineral with a tough resin bond. These layers of web are then cured and compressed together. By fusing layers of open web, the abrasive gains more toughness and durability, so it can withstand repeated wear.
 Ultimately, the wheel's durability is what makes it such a good match for edges. The wheel is tough enough to complete high-pressure edgework without tearing or otherwise disintegrating. Regardless of the diameter or thickness of the wheel, it maintains its structural integrity to remain a stiff and long-lasting abrasive even under high pressure. Additionally, as the layers wear, the wheel can be dressed to maintain its shape.

 Offers tribological performance under high load, including pressure, sliding speed, temperature
 Exhibits high mechanical strength
 Offers excellent thermal conductivity
 Provides excellent corrosion resistance
 3M Silicon Carbide Mechanical Seal Rings are effective for applications where highly aggressive fluids are present. Silicon carbide is an effective material for applications in which wear and corrosion resistance are critical concerns.
 Preferred Choice for Applications with Aggressive Fluids
 3M Silicon Carbide Mechanical Seal Rings offer the performance you need when looking for extended lifetime in highly aggressive fluids. Silicon carbide is a high-strength, lightweight ceramic material that is extremely hard and resistant to wear, chemicals and corrosion – even at high temperatures. These properties allow components made from 3M silicon carbide to withstand some of the most demanding conditions in a wide variety of industries including semiconductor, papermaking, chemical processing and oil and gas production.
 Customized Mechanical Seal Rings
 3M silicon carbide mechanical seal rings can be finish-machined to close tolerances in our fully equipped precision diamond grinding facilities. 3M silicon carbide materials can also be customized for your unique application. 3M specialists will assist you with initial design and development, and our extensive and well-equipped manufacturing facilities allow us to quickly scale-up to full production.
 Durable Under Extreme Conditions
 Our silicon carbide material offers tribological performance under high load, including pressure, sliding speed and temperature. Components manufactured from silicon carbide provide long-lasting service due to its high resistance to wear, resistance to corrosion in aggressive media and thermal shock resistance with low distortion under thermal loads.
 The Differences among Silicon Carbide Grades
 3M offers six grades of silicon carbide in this product, each exhibiting various properties. Differences are described below:
 The all-purpose grade
 3M Silicon Carbide Grade F
 Good chemical resistance, low specific density, high hardness and wear resistance, outstanding thermal conductivity properties and resistance to fluctuations in temperature. 3M silicon carbide grade F combines all these specific advantages of sintered silicon carbide, particularly for bearings and seals for use in pumps.
 The corrosion-resistant grade
 3M Silicon Carbide Grade C
 Resistance to corrosion is a particular problem where aggressive chemicals or hot water are being transferred, e.g. by circulating pumps. 3M silicon carbide grade C has proven highly effective in corrosive environments.
 The high-strength grades
 3M Silicon Carbide Grade F plus and Grade T plus
 Two high-density materials achieve the optimum strength for silicon carbide. These non-porous, fine-grained grades are designed to provide very high mechanical strength and edge stability. 3M silicon carbide grade F plus and grade T plus are ideal materials for complex thermal and mechanical loads.
 The tribological grades
 3M Silicon Carbide Grade P and Grade G
 These grades offer improved dry run and mixed friction properties that are especially valuable in sliding and friction systems.

 Produces finer finishes than conventional electrostatically coated abrasives
 3M Trizact Cloth Belt 237AA uses proprietary microreplication technology by 3M where micron-graded aluminum oxide particles are formed into tiny pyramids of abrasive mineral and then coated on an X weight cloth backing. As these pyramids wear, fresh, sharp mineral is continually exposed to produce a consistent cut and a predictable, fine finish.
 Conventional abrasives start out sharp, but dull quickly
 Built For Dimensioning and Scratch Refinement
 The abrasive and resin structure for the 3M Trizact Cloth Belt 237AA is formulated to break down under medium pressure and keep fresh, sharp mineral cutting to provide consistent finishes on hard metals such as carbon and stainless steel. Our belt also features a grinding aid that helps prevent heat buildup, warping and discoloration. The belt is constructed on an X-weight, durable cloth backing that helps provide control, conformability, and effective medium-pressure grinding. The resin bonded abrasive gives you greater heat resistance and helps prevent delamination.
 The three-dimensional structures of 3M Trizact abrasives contain multiple layers of mineral. As these pyramid-like structures wear, fresh, sharp mineral is constantly exposed to the workpiece, resulting in faster, more consistent cutting throughout the life of the belt.
 Runs Smooth, Finishes Consistently
 The belt uses a Film Media Splice, a strong secure bond joining the belt ends, consisting of a thin film-joining media that minimizes ""chatter marks,"" ensures a smooth running belt, and consistent finishing results. When compared to conventional abrasive products, proprietary Trizact abrasives produce a finer finish, achieve results faster, and last longer.
 Ideal for Robotic Finishing and Polishing
 Robotic metal polishing demands the most consistent, refined cut and long abrasive life. 3M Trizact abrasives can consistently deliver near-mirror finishes while also delivering the abrasive life that helps reduce changeouts and downtime in robotic cells. This helps maximize the efficiency of the cell, allowing you to produce more parts per belt.
 The Science of Flawless Finishes
 Unlike conventional abrasives, our line of 3M Trizact belts start sharp and stay sharp, resulting in more predictable finishes and improved, consistent quality. 3M Trizact belts can last up to five times longer than conventional belts and provide precise finish control such that operators can reduce grade sequences, requiring fewer process steps and fewer abrasive products.

 What is Masking Tape?
 Masking tape was developed specifically to help protect surrounding surfaces from overspray, provide clean paint lines, and remove easily and cleanly when finished. Masking tapes from 3M adhere well, resist solvents or water from the paint, and are strong enough to hang plastic sheeting, yet remove cleanly without damaging the subsurface. The backing, typically crepe paper, can conform to curved and irregular surfaces. The tape hand tears for tool-free application.",Paints and primers,31211500,Paints and primers and finishes,31210000,Manufacturing Components and Supplies,31000000

 Well suited for use on mini random orbital sanders to produce a polish-ready finish
 Silicon carbide mineral in three very fine micron grades
 3M Trizact Finesse-it Film Disc Roll 466LA uses proprietary 3M microreplication technology, micron-graded silicon carbide particles are formed into tiny pyramids of abrasive mineral on a non-compressible 3-mil polyester film backing.
 Trizact Abrasives remove defects, leaving a consistent finish that is easy to polish out
 Fine Sanding and Finish of Automotive Coatings
 Available in three grades -- A3, A5, and A7 -- 3M Trizact Finesse-it Film Disc Roll 466LA is the clearcoat spot repair disc used by automotive manufacturers worldwide. In convenient roll form, these discs are designed for quick access and attachment to rotary tools or orbital sanders.
 While it breaks down faster than aluminum oxide, silicon carbide produces a brighter finish. It's commonly used for defect repair on clear coats, paint and plastics, because it can effectively refine these surfaces without significantly gouging or damaging the workpiece.
 Recommended Applications

 3M Trizact Abrasive surface, 50x magnification
 3M Science. Precision Finishing by Design.
 3M Trizact structured abrasives are precisely shaped engineered composites evenly distributed and bonded to an abrasive backing. These extremely uniform abrasive structures can take the form of almost any three-dimensional geometric shape, including pyramids, hemispheres and cubes, designed to enhance grinding performance. While conventionally coated abrasives often have erratically spaced mineral, Trizact abrasives are identical in height and orientation, wearing just as uniformly. As they do so, fresh, sharp mineral is exposed to produce a consistent cut and a predictable, fine finish. Altogether, this means fewer rejects and less rework due to out of spec results. Ongoing sharp cutting action minimizes the need to incorporate other abrasives in the sequence, thereby reducing processing steps and enhancing productivity.
 In addition to high-performance abrasives, 3M microreplication technology is also used in the manufacture of a variety of 3M products such as overhead projector lenses, reflective traffic signs and solar optical films. It's science, making your world smoother and brighter.

The innovative multi-hole pattern extracts dust better than 5- or 6-hole products — increasing cut and dramatically increasing disc life. The design does not need to align with the disc pad holes, making switching the discs fast, easy and convenient. Advanced Series Abrasives from 3M are designed to deliver an unbeatable combination of performance and value.
 3M Hookit System Enables Easy Tool Attachment
 The 3M Hookit attachment system provides excellent backing support and further simplifies disc changes, optimizing disc life, while the film backing provides a consistent finish. The purple aluminum oxide disc comes in a variety of sizes and is available in a range of grades.
 Open-Coat Construction Minimizes Loading
 Sandpaper discs cut better and last longer when dust isn't loading the cutting surface of the abrasives. Reducing dust is easier than ever with 3M Xtract sanding discs. An open coat means the abrasive grains have space between them so that sanding debris collects in the spaces rather than loading the cutting edge of the grains. The load resistant coating allows the disc to continue cutting even when sanding softwoods, paints, and other materials that would, otherwise, clog the disc and hinder sanding ability. Meanwhile, the innovative multi-hole pattern extracts dust better than 5- or 6-hole products — increasing cut and dramatically increasing disc life.",Distribution,80141700,Marketing and distribution,80140000,Management and Business Professionals and Administrative Services,80000000

 Brushes are built around a steel core, resisting deflection under heavy pressure
 Made with aluminum oxide mineral or silicon carbide for sharp cutting action
 Open web resists loading, contributing to longer abrasive service life
 Open web responds to surface irregularities without altering geometry of the part
 Our Scotch-Brite XDR Clean and Finish Bonded Cleaning Brush cleans and deburrs a variety of hard metals.
 Among our XDR brushes, the Scotch-Brite XDR Clean and Finish Bonded Cleaning Brush offers the greatest flexibility. It's a good option for operators looking for optimum flexibility and an aggressive cut.
 We create Scotch-Brite cleaning brushes by attaching abrasive discs to a cylindrical core and binding them together with resin. The individually bonded discs make our Scotch-Brite XDR brushes more durable, providing 2 to 3 times longer life than standard Scotch-Brite Cleaning Brushes. We construct our flap and cleaning brushes differently, so they may be used for different applications. Typical applications for our cleaning brushes include coil cleaning prior to coating, deburring, scale and oxide removal and reclaiming sheet and coil. Scotch-Brite XDR brushes have steel cores, so the brush stays sturdy when run on finishing equipment. The steel core adds a level of durability to the brush.
 Our Scotch-Brite XDR Clean and Finish Bonded Cleaning Brush is made with aluminum oxide or silicon carbide mineral, which is interspersed on synthetic fibers bonded with resin. The buoyant, open web construction of the fibers makes the abrasive more responsive. Our Scotch-Brite XDR brushes are a good match for cleaning flat surfaces, because they will smooth surface irregularities without sacrificing the geometry of the part. Additionally, the open web resists loading by limiting clogging of the fibers. This keeps the mineral cutting sharper longer.
 We recommend using a lubricant or coolant when cleaning. It assists in washing away swarf and reduces loading, which helps extend the brush's service life.
 Note: When ordering a bonded construction cleaning brush, please allow an additional 1-1/4"" to provide clearance for the 5/8"" lock collars located at both ends of the brush. For instance, if you require 40"" of usable brush width, order a 40"" wide brush. This brush, however, when measured at the core will actually be 41-1/4"" including the lock collars.

 What is Masking Tape?
 Masking tape was developed specifically to help protect surrounding surfaces from overspray, provide clean paint lines, and remove easily and cleanly when finished. Masking tapes from 3M adhere well, resist solvents or water from the paint, and are strong enough to hang plastic sheeting, yet remove cleanly without damaging the subsurface. The backing, typically crepe paper, can conform to curved and irregular surfaces. The tape hand tears for tool-free application.
 A masking tape should specify what surfaces it will stick to and the interval over which it will remove cleanly. A very thin or poorly manufactured tape may demonstrate splintering or shredding, either coming off the roll or when being removed after use. Some masking tapes have the tensile strength for light commercial and industrial applications, including bundling, labeling, sealing, temporary repairs, lane marking, splicing, and surface protection. From wide to narrow, single rolls to bulk, there are many options to choose from when ordering masking tape. The classic crepe paper masking tape is a light tan color, but masking tapes from 3M come in a variety of colors and formulations to meet general and specific applications. From wide to narrow, single rolls to bulk, there are many options to choose from when ordering masking tape. A roll of masking tape is a basic toolbox or supply room item in construction, warehousing, military, marine, shipping, automotive aftermarket, and general manufacturing.",Tape,31201500,Adhesives and sealants,31200000,Manufacturing Components and Supplies,31000000

 Stearate coating helps resist loading for extended performance
 Spiral-patterned design features many small holes for dust extraction and reduced loading
 Multi-hole disc pattern eliminates hole alignment for quicker changes, longer disc life
 3M Hookit attachment system makes for fast, efficient disc change-outs
 Our 3M Hookit Purple Clean Sanding Abrasive Disc 334U combines excellent dust removal and fast cutting, long lasting abrasive for higher productivity and lower cycle times. A spiral pattern clears dust from the surface and reduces loading for longer disc life – up to 3 times longer than traditional auto body abrasive discs. Our 3M Hookit attachment system makes disc change-outs fast and easy.
 Cuts fast, lasts long, resists loading and leaves a consistent finish
 Built for Longer Disc Life
 So much technology in one abrasive disc: our 3M Hookit Purple Clean Sanding Abrasive Disc 334U cuts fast, lasts long, resists loading and leaves a consistent finish across a wide range of applications. It features durable, fast-cutting aluminum oxide abrasive built on C-weight paper backing. A spiral pattern, made up of many tiny holes, keeps particulates away from the surface to reduce loading. When used with dust extraction systems dust will be captured rather than staying on the sanding surface or floating in the air. This pattern also eliminates the need for hole alignment, making it faster and easier to change the discs and extending the abrasive's useful life. Discs are available in grades P240 - P800, ideal for featheredging, fine featheredging or as a last step before priming. They are also great for prepping before blending. Our Hookit attachment system makes for fast and efficient disc change-outs without tools.
 Hard, Tough and Sharp
 3M's fast cutting, long lasting abrasive saves labor costs and improves quality. Aluminum oxide is popular among collision repair professionals because of its fast cut-rate and long life. A natural mineral, it makes a tough, durable abrasive that stays sharp longer. Aluminum oxide is suitable for a wide variety of metalworking materials including ferrous alloys. These discs sand fast to improve technician productivity and reduce labor costs, and the consistent finish reduces rework further improving repair efficiency.
 Spiral Hole Pattern Helps You Get More from Each Disc
 To achieve maximum performance, the discs are designed with small spiral-patterned holes to give dust a better escape route, moving more dust away from your finishing surface without loading the disc.
 Small spiral-patterned holes give dust a better escape route
 The spiral hole configuration allows for optimal particulate removal improving performance when used with or without a dust extraction system. When using dust extraction, hole alignment is not necessary to achieve direct air flow from the workpiece through the abrasive disc. Technicians can change these discs more quickly, saving time and promoting re-use, helping preserve abrasive life. In fact, 3M Hookit Purple Clean Sanding Abrasive Disc 334U can last 2 - 3 times longer than other discs — delivering professional results while improving the bottom line in collision repair.
 Our Hookit Attachment System
 3M offers a complete line of hook-and-loop style Hookit discs for work spaces where adhesive backing may become contaminated by dust, dirt, or flying debris. Hookit discs conveniently and firmly attach to a hook-and-loop backup disc pad (sold separately). It's simple: just attach the disc to the backup pad and start sanding. It removes just as easily and cleanly, and can be re-used again and again for the extent of the abrasive life. To ensure easy, fast attachment, the precise spiral multi-hole pattern of the 3M Hookit Purple Clean Sanding Abrasive Disc 334U does not require hole alignment with the back-up pad.
 Better Science for Better Sanding from 3M
 The 3M Hookit Purple Clean Sanding Abrasive Disc 334U carries our Purple designation (PDF, 195.65 Kb) which indicates the latest 3M technology, greatest performance and highest quality available in an abrasive disc. From its fast-cutting abrasive to its unique spiral-patterned hole design, this disc combines performance, durability and long-lasting efficiency for improved throughput across your entire collision repair operation.

 3M Trizact Abrasive Structure
 Macroreplication is the technology behind the geometrical bricks-and-channels abrasive structure of our 337DC products. These unique abrasive bricks contain up to four times as much mineral as conventional abrasives. As the mineral breaks down, fresh mineral is exposed.
 The macroreplicated pattern of Trizact 337DC discs generates minimal heat. The open spaces between the abrasive bricks channels heat away and removes swarf. This means you can use these discs on substrates like galvanized panels and aluminum hoods.
 Stikit attachment makes disc changeouts fast and easy
 Press On, Peel Off Pressure Sensitive Backing
 Our 3M Stikit system abrasive products come ready to use with a pressure sensitive adhesive coating on the backside so that attaching them is as simple as pressing on a sticker. And because the adhesive is pressure sensitive, the sheet can be peeled off of the pad just as easily, leaving a clean surface for your next sheet.

 High Strength Buff and Blend material has great tear resistance
 Our Standard Abrasives High Strength Mini-Brush restores the original, high-quality finish on fabricated steel parts. While welds or other imperfections might detract from the shininess of the part, the original luster can still be salvaged – even revitalized and renewed – with the help of this abrasive brush.
 Uses a simple repeatable
 procedure that any operator
 can quickly master
 Restore Original Finishes
 Conventional methods for blending weld traces and other imperfections can be time consuming and unpredictable. The Standard Abrasives High Strength Mini-Brush restores the original appearance of your metal parts quickly and easily. Users begin by welding and setting the grain as normal. Then, the Standard Abrasives High Strength Mini-Brush follows to deliver stainless finishes.
 The brush is constructed by attaching thin flaps of nonwoven abrasive material mounted to a fiberglass core. Its design utilizes the ""face"" of the material rather than the ""edge,"" resulting in fine finishes without leaving the traces of lines associated with the ganged arbor hole discs. The flaps are buoyant and responsive, so, rotating on the workpiece they splay out subtly and cover more surface area to eliminate gaps. The brush easily attaches to a die grinder or rotary tool and can be brought to the workpiece if necessary. It is made with high strength (HS) buff and blend material, which has greater tear resistance and is perfect for use on final finishing of irregular shaped parts.
 Benefits of Open Web Abrasives
 Standard Abrasives High Strength Mini-Brush mixes aluminum oxide mineral and nonwoven nylon fibers with a resin bond, resulting in a dense open web. Resin bonds tolerate heat and help enhance overall durability of the abrasive. Aluminum oxide mineral cuts sharp and is friable, fragmenting under heat and pressure to reveal sharp cutting edges, so you get a consistent cut throughout the life of the abrasive. Gaps between the nonwoven nylon fibers allow swarf and debris to escape, so the abrasive does not get clogged with buildup and keeps cutting sharper for longer. Moreover, the nylon fibers are buoyant and responsive, so you get a consistent cut without gouging or marring the workpiece. Given that maintaining part geometry — especially on fabricated steel parts — is often a top concern, the mini-brush's ability to conform to the substrate without compromising part geometry is one of its key benefits. It helps reduce the likelihood of having to discard scrap parts due to incorrect tolerances, as well as minimize the need for rework.
 Use a Standard Abrasives
 Mini-Brush on a rotary sander
 to quickly generate a
 high-quality finish
 Variations of the High Strength Mini-Brush
 The Standard Abrasives High Strength Mini-Brush is color coded by grade to help users quickly identify the right grade for their application. Grades include medium (MED) and coarse (CRS). Medium grades will cut less aggressively but leave a finer scratch pattern, whereas coarse grades will cut more aggressively and leave a rougher scratch pattern.
 Altogether, the High Strength Mini-Brushes are quality abrasives, providing users with a fast and easy way to restore workpiece finishes to their original condition.

 Roloc quick attachment system provides for easy disc changes between grades or applications
 YF-weight backing supports medium to high pressure grinding applications
 3M Cubitron II Roloc Disc 984F offers a superior solution for tackling metalworking applications where flexibility is required, such as weld grinding, beveling, flame-cut edge clean-up and deburring.
 3M Roloc Discs provide a fast, efficient method for grinding, blending, leveling and finishing on all types of metal
 To save time and increase throughput, our 3M Cubitron II Roloc Disc 984F combines the convenience of the 3M Roloc Quick-Change Attachment System with 3M proprietary Precision-Shaped Grain (PSG) technology, delivering outstanding cut rates and disc life. Because PSG contributes to an exceptionally high cut-rate with less pressure, operators can finish tough tasks faster and with less fatigue. A heat-activated grinding aid incorporated on the disc makes this an outstanding product for all types of metal—it helps keep the disc cooler on stainless steel and heat-sensitive metals such as nickel alloys and titanium, thereby reducing metal discoloration/oxidation and the chance of heat-related stress cracks. Constructed on a YF weight, water resistant 2-ply polyester backing for added durability, our disc 984F features a grinding aid that helps keep the disc cooler on stainless steel and heat-sensitive metals such as nickel alloys and titanium.
 To create PSG, our team of engineers started with 3M Ceramic Abrasive Grain and used proprietary technology to form the grains into triangular structures and electrostatically orient them on the backing to form sharp peaks that maximize cutting potential. These peaks slice cleanly through metal like a knife through butter, rather than gouging or plowing as traditional abrasives do, and continuously self-sharpen as the points break off. This generates a super-fast cut and lessens heat build-up due to friction, reducing heat-related stress cracks and discoloration. PSG also wears evenly, and because the abrasive itself stays cooler and sharper, Cubitron II products last significantly longer than their conventional ceramic counterparts, ensuring extended high performance in production applications.
 3M Cubitron II Roloc Disc 984F is available for use with the following Roloc attachment system: TR.

 Broad chemical and temperature resistance
 3M Dyneon Fluoroelastomer FE 5730 is a medium fluorine, intermediate viscosity, bimodal terpolymer for extrusion applications. No process aid is required when this fluoroelastomer is properly compounded. Additionally, our Dyneon fluoroelastomer FE 5730 offers broad chemical and temperature resistance for product durability and longevity.
 Chemical and Temperature Resistance
 3M Dyneon Fluoroelastomer FE 5730 is a terpolymer of vinylidene fluoride, hexafluoropropylene and tetrafluoroethylene. Dyneon fluoroelastomer FE 5730 can be compounded using standard water cooled internal mixers or two-roll mills with standard fillers and ingredients utilized in typical fluoroelastomer formulations. The dry ingredients should be blended before adding to the masticated gum. For best results, FE 5730 should be banded on the mill several minutes prior to adding the blended dry ingredients. Once mixed, the compounded stocks have good scorch resistance and storage stability.
 Dyneon fluoroelastomer FE 5730 has high fluorine content (69.2%), but lower fluorine than similar products like 3M Dyneon Fluoroelastomer FE 5830Q. This product has an incorporated cure technology that may help save time and increase throughput. In addition, this product produces smooth extrudates without the use of processing aids, and can be formulated to yield good permeation resistance to automotive fuels.
 The benefits don’t end there; Dyneon fluoroelastomer FE 5730 has low permeation and offers very good chemical and temperature resistance to create durable and long-lasting finished products, such as mandrel bend fuel hoses formulated to meet -40C (-40F) specifications.
 The Right Size to Fit the Job
 This product is sold in different sizes, so compounders and formulators can pick the right size for the job. Dyneon fluoroelastomer FE 5730 is packaged in milled slab form (as opposed to unmilled forms like crumb) and is available in a returnable bulk shipping container system for 1,320 Ibs (600 kg) of material. The bulk container system is comprised of 48 individual polyethylene bags containing 27.5 Ibs (12.5 kg) of product. Smaller quantities are available in 55.1 Ibs (25.0 kg) boxes.

 3M Accuspray HGP Spray Gun Kit quickly delivers coatings onto any rigid textured panels on the vehicle. The precision delivery of these coatings allows product to be sprayed at any angle to match OEM textured finishes. Because the spray gun is so accurate, less masking is required and overspray is reduced, practically eliminating solvent use needed for clean-up. The fan and fluid controls on the spray gun can be adjusted, so operators can tailor the texture and appearance to their preferences. We recommend experimenting on a test panel prior applying the undercoating to determine accurate gun settings. Altogether, this complete system of 3M Rocker Protector Pouch and spray gun was engineered to make this tough but critical job easy, swift and efficient for operators.

 Strong, Reinforced Repairs
 When properly used with fiberglass resin, Dynatron Fiberglass Mat reinforces repair areas and allows for repainting so that the repair looks like the original surface once the job is complete. Fiberglass mat is easy to cut to size and shape for customized repairs on automobiles. Fiberglass mat is often used with fiberglass cloth and fiberglass resin for repairs. Once the patched area has cured, it can be sanded smoothly so that it is level with the surrounding surface. A fiberglass repair completed with resin and mat is fully compatible with being painted.
 Benefits of Fiberglass Mat
 Fiberglass mat consists of short strands of fiberglass bonded together with a resin. While not as strong as fiberglass cloth, fiberglass mat can be used to build thickness between layers of fiberglass cloth. Fiberglass mat offers numerous other benefits, including a resistance to expansion or contraction as temperatures change. Fiberglass mat will not absorb moisture and is non-flammable. Our fiberglass mat is also resistant to most chemicals.
 Repairs Customized to Your Needs
 Our fiberglass mat is highly pliable, enabling it to conform to curved surfaces on automobiles. The flexible nature of the mat allows for customized automotive bodywork repairs on fenders, doors, hoods and other sections of the car body.

 Dense natural pile conforms to contours for even finishing
 Aggressive cut quickly removes oxidation and scratches with less heat buildup
 3M Hookit attachment system holds pad securely and provides quick disc/pad change-out
 Pads combine with buffers, random orbital tools, and variable speed polishers to produce desired final finish
 3M Finesse-it Natural Buffing Pad is made with select lamb’s wool hide, trimmed to 20 mm length to offer a more aggressive cut than longer-fiber pads. The natural hide holds each fiber individually, which minimizes lint discharge. The dense pile surface holds the polish for even, consistent material distribution while minimizing splatter and jumping.
 Our Finesse-it Natural Buffing Pad is ideal for buffing automotive OEM, marine, and aerospace coatings. When used in conjunction with our Finesse-it polishes, the pad quickly removes finishing abrasive sand scratches, oxidation, and other paint surface defects. Resulting finish may require a follow up polishing step with a finer pad to completely remove swirl marks. This pad is manufactured with the 3M Hookit attachment system for quick pad mounting and removal, and to hold the pad securely in place during use. Our Hookit buffing pads conveniently and firmly attach to a hook-and-loop backup disc pad (sold separately) on rotary or random orbital tools, can be removed cleanly and easily, and can be re-used again and again for the life of the pad. Finish results are dependent on specific polish used, coating type, and the tool used.
 Wool buffing pads are generally more aggressive and easier to control than foam pads. They have a greater available cutting surface area due to the presence of thousands of fibers. These fibers provide faster cutting action than foam pads, Wool fibers hold the polish to provide even distribution of material and require less pressure from the operator. The nap helps wool pads glide and conform to contours, making them easier to control than foam pads. Because of their cutting ability, wool pads are effective for removing sanding scratches and perform best on rotary type buffing tools. Depending on the polish type, individual technique, composition of the coating, and the tool used, finishing with a wool pad may require a follow-up step with a foam pad and polish to remove micro-marring or swirl marks.
 Our Finesse-it products are a line of specially engineered abrasives, compounds, polishes, and buffing pads to be used on OEM and baked refinish paints to remove defects, sand scratches, or swirl marks on a variety of painted surfaces. 3M Finesse-it products are an integral part of a 3M recommended buffing system for repairing surface defects to clear coats, lacquered wood, solid surfaces, gelcoat, powder coat, industrial paint, acrylic, and glass.",Integrated circuits,32101600,Printed circuits and integrated circuits and microassemblies,32100000,Electronic Components and Supplies,32000000

 Terms to know
 TSER – Total Solar Energy Rejection
 The percentage of total solar energy rejected by filmed glass. The higher this value, the less solar heat is transmitted.
 VLT – Visible Light Transmitted
 The percentage of visible light that passes directly through filmed glass: the higher the number, the lighter the film.
 Ultraviolet Rejection
 The percentage of ultraviolet (UV) light that is rejected by the filmed glass. UV light contributes to the fading and deterioration of fabrics and leather.
 IRR – Infrared Rejection**
 The percentage of solar infrared energy rejection over the wavelength range from 900-1,000 nm. Infrared rays are primarily responsible for the heat you feel when driving.
 IRER – Infrared Energy Rejection***
 The percent of solar infrared energy rejection over the wavelength range from 780–2,500 nm. IRER takes into account the transmitted and absorbed IR energy that will be reradiated into a car.
 Glare Reduction
 The percentage by which visible light is reduced by the addition of film. Data shown is the estimated performance of film applied to ¼” (6mm) thick, 73% VLT automotive green glass. Data is for reference only.
 NOTE: Auto tint laws vary by state or province. Please check your local laws or ask your dealer installer for films that meet your local tint laws.
 Limited Lifetime Warranty: Sold and installed by professional 3M Authorized Dealer Installers and backed by a limited lifetime warranty.

 The Big Benefits of Small Area Repair
 Our 3M Paint Defect Removal Hand Sanding System Kit puts in your hands an entire system for removing small dirt defects in auto body paint surfaces. With its small, film-backed abrasive sheets and cards and its fingertip-operated sanding pads and tools, this kit contains our entire range of products for small area repair. Simply choose a circular abrasive sheet, a rectangular abrasive sheet or an Abrasive Card and press it firmly onto a cylinder, a small rectangular sanding block or a foam or rubber backing pad. Our Stikit adhesive backing on the abrasives keeps them firmly in place. You get a strong, secure handheld microsanding tool that lets you eliminate individual dirt nibs or other defects — along with the time and expense of sanding, compounding and polishing entire freshly-painted panels. It also significantly reduces compound slush, saving cleanup time.

 3M Paint Defect Removal Hand System requires less compounding and polishing
 Abrasives and Hand Sanding Tools for Any Defect Removal Job
 This kit features every product in our Paint Defect Removal Hand Sanding System. Film-backed Abrasive Circle Sheets, Abrasive Rectangle Sheets and Abrasive Cards are included in each of five grades ranging from P1000 to P3000. These abrasives snap securely onto any handheld tool or backing pad, including a Cylinder, a Block, a Foam Pad and a Rubber Pad designed specifically for precision hand sanding on flat or contoured surfaces. Rectangular Abrasive Cards are slightly larger for areas with larger or multiple defects. Each kit includes a flexible version of the card for sanding contours. The Cylinder and the Block are firm and stiff, great for cutting out just the nib without sanding the area around it. With just a small amount of compound and polish, you can re-create smooth, high gloss finishes that match OEM in much less time and at much less expense.
 Tough Abrasive, Smooth Results
 The film-backed abrasive sheets and cards in our Paint Defect Removal Hand Sanding System Kit feature our fast-cutting, long-lasting aluminum oxide mineral abrasive. Aluminum oxide is popular among industrial professionals because of its fast cut-rate and long life. This mineral makes a tough, durable abrasive that self-fractures to expose fresh cutting edges during use, whereas traditional natural abrasives dull more quickly. This coated abrasive is optimized for sanding small areas.
 Our Stikit Attachment System
 The abrasives in this kit come ready to use with a pressure-sensitive adhesive coating on the backs — simply press them onto the hand tool or pad, and you're ready to go. They remove just as cleanly, leaving an uncontaminated surface for the next abrasive. This makes it fast and easy to use, switch and reuse multiple abrasive shapes and grades on any of the handheld tools and pads in the kit, saving time, boosting productivity and helping you get the most out of each abrasive.
 Increased Sanding Capabilities at Maximum Value
 Along with everything you need for effectively repairing small paint defects, the kit includes a reorder form that lets you order quantities of each component in our Paint Defect Removal Hand Sanding System. This allows you the flexibility to restock only the product you use the most, maximizing value while still keeping the full range of small area repair capabilities at your fingertips.

 Understanding Epoxy Adhesives
 Epoxy adhesives are part of the class of adhesives called ""structural adhesives,"" which include polyurethane, acrylic, cyanoacrylate and others. Epoxies are formulated as liquid reactive polymers that undergo a chemical reaction when mixed and then cure to form a solid plastic material. Once the two parts are mixed in their specified ratio, they begin the curing process and offer a limited working time where the adhesive can be applied and the two surfaces positioned as needed. This work life lasts anywhere from a few minutes to several hours. These structural adhesives provide high shear and peel strengths, depending on the formula, and better heat and chemical resistance than other common adhesives. In general, epoxy adhesives have the highest overall strength and offer the best performance and most resistance to high temperatures, solvents and outdoor weathering.
 Epoxy adhesive (often referred to as epoxy glue) is widely used in building and home construction; aircraft and automobile manufacturing; bicycle, boat, golf clubs, ski and snowboard assembly as well as a host of home use and other applications. It is used virtually anywhere high-strength bonds are needed along with resistance to environmental conditions. These adhesives are popular for their ease of use, mechanical strength and chemical resistance. Formulations can be created to make epoxy for plastic flexible or epoxy for metal rigid, epoxy resin transparent or opaque, quick setting or slow setting. The versatility with which these adhesives can be formulated helps meet almost any requirement for bonding wood, metal, glass, stone and various plastics.",Pneumatic tools,27131500,Pneumatic machinery and equipment,27130000,Tools and General Machinery,27000000

 Brushes are built around a steel core, resisting deflection under heavy pressure
 Made with silicon carbide mineral for sharp cutting action
 Open web resists loading, contributing to longer abrasive service life
 Open web responds to surface irregularities without altering geometry of the part
 Our Scotch-Brite XDR Clean and Strip Bonded Cleaning Brush effectively cleans metal and is a trusted abrasive for your most heavy-duty cleaning applications.
 Aggressively Cleans Metal Sheet or Coil
 Our Scotch-Brite XDR Clean and Strip Bonded Cleaning Brush is one of our most aggressive-cutting XDR cleaning brushes. This dense brush helps remove rust, corrosion, light mill scale and other contaminants from metal sheet or coil.
 Steel core adds durability
 Durable Construction Around a Steel Core
 We create Scotch-Brite cleaning brushes by attaching abrasive discs to a cylindrical core and binding them together with resin. The individually bonded discs make our Scotch-Brite XDR brushes more durable, providing 2 to 3 times longer life than standard Scotch-Brite cleaning brushes. We construct our flap and cleaning brushes differently, so they may be used for different applications. Typical applications for our cleaning brushes include coil cleaning prior to coating, deburring, scale and oxide removal and reclaiming sheet and coil. Scotch-Brite XDR Brushes have steel cores, so the brush stays sturdy when run on finishing equipment. The steel core adds a level of durability to the wheel.
 Ideal for use on coil stock, sheet stock and flat parts
 Flexible Fibers Deliver a Sharp Cut
 Our Scotch-Brite XDR Clean and Strip Bonded Cleaning Brush is made with silicon carbide mineral interspersed on synthetic fibers. Silicon carbide is sharp and hard, which makes it a good match for cutting hard materials like metal. The buoyant, open web construction of the fibers makes the abrasive more responsive. Our Scotch-Brite XDR brushes are a good match for cleaning flat surfaces, because they will smooth surface irregularities without sacrificing the geometry of the part. Additionally, the open web resists loading by limiting clogging of the fibers and keeps the mineral cutting sharper longer.
 Use with Coolant
 We recommend using a lubricant or coolant when cleaning. It helps wash away swarf and reduce loading on the abrasive, which, subsequently, extends brush life and enhances performance.
 Note: When ordering a bonded construction cleaning brush, please allow an additional 1-1/4"" to provide clearance for the 5/8"" lock collars located at both ends of the brush. For instance, if you require 40"" of usable brush width, order a 40"" wide brush. This brush, however, when measured at the core will actually be 41-1/4"" including the lock collars.

 Soft to Medium Density Silicon Carbide Wheel Accomplishes Tough Finishing Applications
 Our Standard Abrasives Quick Change Silicon Carbide (S/C) Unitized Wheel 600 Series has a soft to medium density when compared to other wheels in our Standard Abrasives Unitized Wheels line. Constructed with fine (FIN) grade silicon carbide, this double-duty non-woven abrasive wheel combines durability with a fine scratch pattern, making it a great choice for projects that require an aggressive cut yet soft finish — namely, tough finishing and polishing applications.
 When it comes to polishing, trust Standard Abrasives S/C 600 Series Unitized Wheel for polishing fillet areas on jet blades and aircraft parts, polishing after weld removal and polishing mold and die, cast aluminum, brass and copper. It's also a good match for finishing of surgical instruments and prosthetics.
 Due to their conformability, these wheels are great for projects with strict tolerances, because they respond to surface irregularities. After prolonged use, the wheel may be dressed to maintain its shape.
 Quick Change Wheels Increase Throughput
 Standard Abrasives Quick Change Unitized Wheels are available in smaller sizes. Quick change wheels allow tool-free swap outs, maintain secure attachment at high speeds, and save operators time when switching discs between grades or applications. Easy fastening and swapping of wheels enhances tool efficiency and worker productivity.
 Choose the wheel compatible with your TR or TS holder pad. TR wheels have a nylon threaded male hub that easily threads onto TR or 3M Roloc type holder pads with a turn of the wrist, and the TS system has a metal hub that fastens to its holder pad with a simple twist.
 All Standard Abrasives TS and TR holder pads have a 1/4-20 female thread. A 1/4"" TA4 mandrel attaches the holder pad to the tool (sold separately, part number 540013).

 in a variety of cleaning, deburring,
 finishing and polishing applications
 Non-Woven Unitized Construction Offers a Step Up in Density and Durability for Stubborn Surfaces
 Standard Abrasives Unitized Wheels are a great match for tough deburring, cleaning, blending and finishing applications. They come in a broad range of densities and grades to suit different metals, the degree of aggressiveness required, shape of the part, and desired finish. Although used for some of the same tasks as Standard Abrasives Buff and Blend products, they are designed with a far stronger and denser construction to support more aggressive applications and accomplish material removal more rapidly. Even though unitized wheels are much stiffer products, the non-woven nylon fibers of the wheel maintain the advantage of responding to surface irregularities while preserving the geometry of the piece, and produce a consistent finish.
 Unitized wheels are created by starting with layers of open web material that combines non-woven fiber strands and abrasive mineral with a tough resin bond. These layers of web are then cured and compressed together. By fusing layers of open web, the abrasive gains more toughness and durability, so it can withstand repeated wear.
 Ultimately, the wheel's durability is what makes it such a good match for edges. Regardless of the diameter or thickness of the wheel, it maintains its structural integrity to remain a stiff and long-lasting abrasive even under high pressure. Additionally, as the layers wear, the wheel can be dressed to maintain its shape.
 Load-Resistant Construction Boosts Life and Performance
 Standard Abrasives Unitized Wheels are load-resistant to keep you cutting with fresh mineral. The gaps in the open web allow unwanted swarf to escape. Consequently, less debris clogs the abrasive, so the mineral can stay fresh, keep cutting sharp and deliver a consistent cut over the life of the product.
 As the fibers break down and fresh mineral is exposed, it reduces the likelihood of dull or blunt mineral smearing the surface, contributing to cleaner surfaces and less re-work. Furthermore, manual fatigue that may result from applying heavy pressure to a dull abrasive is reduced.
 The Many Benefits of Standard Abrasives Non-Woven Products
 Standard Abrasives Unitized Wheels offer many benefits for heavy-duty jobs. For all the aforementioned reasons, Standard Abrasives Unitized Wheels invigorate deburring, cleaning, blending and finishing applications by helping operators reduce finishing steps, minimize costs and achieve greater throughput.",Abrasive wheels,31191600,Grinding and polishing and smoothing materials,31190000,Manufacturing Components and Supplies,31000000

 About 3M Cubitron II and Precision-Shaped Grain
 3M Cubitron II abrasive discs, cutoff wheels and file belts have raised the bar for high-performing abrasives. Cubitron abrasives feature our Precision-Shaped Grain (PSG) technology, which allows our engineers to control the geometry of the abrasive grain for a truly fast, efficient cut. Instead of simply crushing the abrasive into particles, 3M uses microreplication to uniformly size ceramic grains and precisely shape them into triangular structures — essentially, sharp peaks that slice, not plow, through paint and metal. These grains are electrostatically oriented on the abrasive surface for the most efficient cut and even wear. What's more, PSG fractures during use to maintain sharp abrasive edges. The result: Cubitron II cuts 30% faster and lasts 2x longer than conventional ceramic abrasives.
 Wears evenly and provides super-long life and consistency at any grinding pressure

 Flap Brush Family
 Quality Materials and Construction for Demanding Finishing Applications
 Standard Abrasives Buff and Blend products are made from tough, resin-reinforced nylon fiber with aluminum oxide abrasive grain. The durable high strength construction of our Standard Abrasives Buff and Blend Flap Brush provides aggressive, controlled action and a consistent, uniform finish without leaving behind parting lines. Non-woven construction conforms to workpiece contours, curves, and ridges and allows removing surface contaminants without eliminating critical detail or gouging the workpiece. Choose from a broad offering of sizes, densities and grades to suit many different finishing operations.
 A Buff and Blend Flap Brush is an ideal choice for:
 A grain finish on brass strike plates for door hardware
 A satin finish on builders' hardware (cabinet handles, door knobs, and more)
 Satin finishes on soft metals
 Inline brushed finishes on aluminum and stainless cookware (pots and pans)
 Producing fine scratch patterns on utensils and cutlery prior to cotton buff and compound polishing
 Removing oxide from precious metals
 Blending flash and parting lines on aluminum die cast
 Featuring Consistent Finishes and Operator Comfort
 Flap brushes produce a consistent finish which does not reflect lines commonly attributed with ganged arbor hole discs. Density, pressure and angle determine the ability of the flap brush to remove burrs, oxidation and handling marks. The abrasive material provides ventilation which helps dissipate heat and, therefore, runs cooler. This provides consistent finishes without smearing or otherwise discoloring the work piece. Minimal vibration can reduce chattermarks on the workpiece and can lead to less operator and machine fatigue.
 Load-Resistant Construction Boosts Life and Performance
 Standard Abrasives Buff and Blend products are load-resistant to keep you cutting with fresh mineral. The gaps in the open web allow unwanted swarf to escape. Consequently, less debris clogs the abrasive, so the mineral can stay fresh, keep cutting sharp and deliver a consistent cut over the life of the product. As the fibers break down and fresh mineral is exposed, it reduces the likelihood of dull or blunt mineral smearing the surface, contributing to cleaner surfaces and less re-work. Furthermore, manual fatigue that may result from applying heavy pressure to a dull abrasive is reduced.
 The Many Benefits of Standard Abrasives Buff and Blend Products
 Standard Abrasives Buff and Blend products invigorate deburring, cleaning, blending and finishing applications by helping operators reduce finishing steps, minimize costs and achieve greater throughput. Each Buff and Blend product and grade offers unique benefits, so operators can choose from a versatile range of options to ensure superior performance on specific applications.",Machined die castings,31121100,Machined castings,31120000,Manufacturing Components and Supplies,31000000

With an internal polypropylene/polyethylene web, an overall thickness of 27 mm and a basis weight of just 232 g/m2, it features excellent compressibility and recovery. A 100% polypropylene scrim reinforces the web on both sides.
 Very Light Weight for Mass Reduction
 Part of our TC family of cavity filling solutions for automotive OEM, 3M Thinsulate Acoustic Insulation TC2303 (PDF, 196.9 Kb) has one of the highest acoustic absorption-to-weight ratios of any Thinsulate product. This very low density (7.7 kg/m3) insulation is excellent as an NVH cavity filler for applications where mass reduction is a major goal. Its internal web features thick and thin fibers and is designed specifically to absorb vibration and help reduce unwanted noise from traveling throughout vehicles.
 Built for Lasting Noise Absorption
 The internal web of the product is composed of a combination of polyester (PE) and polypropylene (PP) fibers. The PP fibers are extremely fine, allowing for high-energy absorption without adding weight. The thicker PE fibers add loft, strength and stability to the web. The lightweight reinforcing white scrim on both sides is made from 100% polypropylene non-woven fabric for durability.
 Properties of 3MThinsulate Acoustic Insulation TC2303
 This acoustic insulation material has a caliper of 27 mm and a basis weight of just 232 gm/m². Fibers are contained in a double white scrim.
 Compressible and Conformable for Gap Filling
 Thinsulate Acoustic Insulation TC2303 is designed for excellent compressibility and recovery. This is ideal for applications where filling spaces of varying thickness is important, such as door trim panels and body side trim panels. As the insulation conforms, it completely fills even irregular spaces for extremely consistent noise absorption throughout the application. It is most effective as an NVH cavity filler.
 Our Thinsulate Acoustic Insulation TC2303 can be processed by conventional techniques such as die cutting. It attaches easily using ultrasonic welding, hot melt adhesive or mechanical fasteners.

 Reasons Why Automotive Manufacturers Choose 3M Thinsulate Acoustic Insulation
 Quieter Vehicles. Provides highly efficient acoustic absorption, particularly in middle- to high-frequency ranges.
 Lighter Vehicles. Thinsulate acoustic insulation products are made from lightweight polyester and polypropylene non-woven fibers.
 Easy to Install. Lightweight and easy to handle compared fiberglass, shoddy, felt and PET.
 Mold, Mildew and Moisture Resistant. Install just the insulation — there's no need for an additional waterproof layer during application. Thinsulate acoustic insulation is also resistant to mildew growth, reducing the risk of offensive odors
 Efficient Assembly. Attach our acoustic insulation using a variety of methods including ultrasonic welding, double-sided tape or mechanical clips.
 Manufacturing Support. Thinsulate acoustic insulation is supported by a global network of 3M experts. Custom die cutting services are available.
 The Science Behind How Thinsulate Acoustic Insulation Absorbs Noise
 All sound is transmitted through the air as waves. These acoustic waves oscillate at differing frequencies. When oscillating waves contact the fine fibers of our Thinsulate acoustic insulation, the resulting friction turns their acoustic energy into heat. The heat irreversibly dissipates and reduces sound. As a result, 3M Thinsulate Acoustic Insulation applied to automotive interiors reduces interior noise for a quieter, more comfortable ride.
 About Our 3M Thinsulate Acoustic Insulation TC Series
 As part of a full range of Thinsulate acoustic insulation products, the TC Series provides among the lowest weights along with the highest lofts at any given basis weight. It is also the easiest to compress, and features excellent compression recovery. The TC Series fills voids more completely and reduces vibration more effectively, making it ideal as an NVH cavity filler in pillars and behind trim panels, headliners or instrument panels.

 Terms to know
 TSER – Total Solar Energy Rejection
 The percentage of total solar energy rejected by filmed glass. The higher this value, the less solar heat is transmitted.
 VLT – Visible Light Transmitted
 The percentage of visible light that passes directly through filmed glass: the higher the number, the lighter the film.
 Ultraviolet Rejection
 The percentage of ultraviolet (UV) light that is rejected by the filmed glass. UV light contributes to the fading and deterioration of fabrics and leather.
 IRR – Infrared Rejection*
 The percentage of solar infrared energy rejection over the wavelength range from 900-1,000 nm. Infrared rays are primarily responsible for the heat you feel when driving.
 IRER – Infrared Energy Rejection**
 The percent of solar infrared energy rejection over the wavelength range from 780–2,500 nm. IRER takes into account the transmitted and absorbed IR energy that will be reradiated into a car.
 Glare Reduction
 The percentage by which visible light is reduced by the addition of film. Data shown is the estimated performance of film applied to ¼” (6mm) thick, 73% VLT automotive green glass. Data is for reference only.

 Lead-Free Balancing Weights
 The 3M Wheel Weight System combines conformable wheel balancing material and industry-leading 3M Automotive Attachment Tape to provide an all-in-one, securely attached wheel weight balancing system. Designed to have less impact on the environment than industry standard lead weights, the 3M Wheel Weight System is a proprietary product with unique properties built to meet our customers' ever-increasing needs for lead-free, quality products. The 3M Wheel Weight System consists of a flexible and conformable material available in an easy-to-use, self-dispensing package used with a stand and cutting device.
 3M Science Eliminates a Source of Lead Contamination
 According to the EPA, approximately 1.6 million pounds of lead wheel weights are lost in the United States when they fall off during normal driving conditions. These weights can enter our environment in a variety of ways, including being washed into storm sewers or gathered during street cleaning and disposed of in landfills. A growing number of jurisdictions are introducing and passing legislation that bans the use of lead wheel weights. Our lead-free, composite material provides a more environmentally friendly alternative without sacrificing performance. In addition to environmental benefits, our wheel weights also resist the corrosion that is common with lead weights, which enhances overall tire appearance.

 For a Better Finish, Start Here
 We built some of our latest discoveries into our 3M Hookit Purple Finishing Film Abrasive Disc 260L to help you achieve a consistent, professional and easy-to-polish finish with reduced pigtails during dry sanding. Our 3M Hookit Purple Finishing Film Abrasive Discs 260L are built onto a durable film backing that adds conformability, and our specially formulated coating preserves the life of the aluminum oxide mineral. The 260L discs are ideal for leveling orange peel, dust nibs or paint runs in all types of automotive paint, gel coat and clear coat. The 3M Hookit Purple Finishing Film Abrasive Discs are used for scuffing blend areas prior to painting and removing defects prior to paint finishing. The new discs are much faster and easier to use than scuffing pads. The discs produce fewer pigtails during any application and reduce deep scratches, comebacks and rework, saving time and money in collision repair operations.
 Several versions of our 260L abrasive discs are designed with hole patterns to give dust a better escape route, moving more dust away from your finishing surface without loading the disc. This makes for a cleaner work environment, a cleaner work surface and longer disc life.

 To create a ribbon bead, use a 3M OEM Sealer Tip - 3/8 inch Flat PN 08204
 We designed 3M Factory-Match Seam Sealer using two part urethane technology to provide a tough flexible material for the sealing of joints on primed or painted substrates such as steel or aluminum enclosures. This material provides excellent flexibility and elongation properties along with a medium/high viscosity and produces a slight flow-out after application.
 3M Factory-Match Seam Sealer is part of a family of quality automotive products
 Eliminate Downtime
 Single component sealers require significant dry time before components can be handled or further processed in your shop. Our high-performance 3M Factory-Match Seam Sealer operates with a two-part cartridge and nozzle that self-mixes with a perfect formulation every time allowing for fast easy application and quicker cycle time than with one part sealers. 3M Factory-Match Seam Sealer may be top coated with paints in 45 minutes under normal conditions.
 Match OEM Appearances
 This professional-quality black seam sealer (PDF, 27 Kb) can be used to seal vertical or horizontal seams on automotive surfaces primed with a 2K urethane, 2K epoxy primer, or clean, sanded paint. Its slight flow-out softens on the edges, without tooling, giving a rounded appearance. This flexible rounded seam seal is suitable for duplicating factory door skin seams and matching OEM beads.
 Manual applicator PN 08571 for seam sealer (sold separately)
 Durable, Fast-Cure Formula Creates a High Quality Seal
 Our flexible formula works within a wide range of temperatures with no shrinking or cracking to achieve strong, durable construction. It offers a fast setup time of 10 minutes, decreasing downtime and allowing technicians to continue repair procedures quicker for increased productivity. Moreover, the fast-cure formula means there is a limited time of uncured product on the car and the risk of damaging the seam by disturbing uncured seam sealer is greatly reduced. This enables technicians to quickly achieve a long-lasting, high quality seam seal.
 Using the Seam Sealer Effectively
 3M Factory-Match Seam Sealer can be used with the following 3M Applicators: PN 08117 (manual), PN 08571 (manual), and PN 09930 (pneumatic). Also use 3M Mix Nozzle: PN 08193 (6/bag), PN 8194 (50/box) and 3M OEM Sealer Tip PNs 08201 — 08205.

 3M best practice is that all sealers, unless designated specifically for use on bare metal, be applied to properly prepared automotive paint or primer. Apply only to surfaces primed with a 2K urethane, 2K epoxy primer, or clean, sanded paint. Acid etch primers should never be in direct contact with seam sealer. Prior to application, scuff primed surface with a Scotch-Brite General Purpose Hand Pad, PN 07448 (Ultrafine).

 Get Better Results When Sanding by Hand
 3M Hookit Sanding Block is the perfect companion when using 3M Hookit abrasives. Our sanding block fits comfortably in the hand to help reduce instances of hand fatigue. The block allows for a more even and consistent application of pressure, which delivers more uniform results. A sanding block also lets you apply more pressure than you could simply with your hand, a benefit that will speed how quickly you can complete your project.
 Benefits of Sanding by Hand
 Our blocks make hand sanding a more efficient task, which helps boost overall productivity when power sanding is not an option. Automotive restoration technicians like power sanding due to it speed and ease, but some applications do not allow for power sanding. In those cases, you can still gain efficiency by using our sanding blocks. Use these blocks for areas out of reach of power sanding tools. Hand sanding is also preferred for situations in which you need more precise control. With the speed of power sanders, one lingering pause can result in irreversible damage in certain situations. Hand sanding allows you to work at a pace that's suitable for more delicate work. Hand sanding also produces less dust if that is a concern.
 Enjoy the Ease and Speed of the Hookit Attachment System
 These sanding blocks use the 3M Hookit attachment system for easy replacement of sandpaper sheets. Simply press on the abrasive sheet to get a secure grip, and then peel it away for easy removal. Hookit is the perfect time-saving answer when you're switching between abrasive grits frequently. Best of all, you can remove and reattach an abrasive that still has a useful service life. Let's say you need to switch to a different grit but the abrasives on the sheet you're currently using are not fully spent. Simply remove it and reattach later. Hookit ensures that you will get the same secure hold, which is an important advantage compared to pressure sensitive attachment products where the adhesive may be compromised after being removed.

 3M Perfect-It for Today's Harder Clear Coats
 Developed to keep pace with evolving paint and clear coat technologies, choose the Perfect-it Paint Finishing System when the finest finish is required for every level of clear coat and paint repair. An integral part of that system, we designed the 3M Perfect-It Low-Linting Wool Compounding Pad with 100% wool for your most aggressive scratch removal applications.
 Fast and Furious
 Today's wool pads have evolved as well. They maintain the aggression, but shed the cloud of lint that many associate with wool pads. Wool pads have undeniable advantages, especially on today's much harder and more scratch resistant clear coat. Wool not only cuts faster than foam, but it stays cooler by creating less friction and dissipating heat through the wool fibers, making it preferable for heat-sensitive areas of a car, boat, or plane, such as spoilers and bumpers.
 Wool pads also cut down on the bumping that is typical of foam pads, meaning the operator gains a smoother and more controlled application. Wool glides easily over panels, whether flat or contoured. While it may load with product more quickly that foam, spurring the wool fibers restores performance. Hold the pad flat against the part for a more even application and to reduce slinging.
 Quick Connect Design
 This pad has a unique quick connect design. It's easy to attach or remove pads to polishers, and they perfectly center each pad every time. The performance and convenience benefits of these pads set them apart from all pads on the market.
 With the adapter's sliding ring, you can easily attach or a pad in seconds. But when the locking system is engaged, the adapter provides a reliable connection between the pad and polisher to ensure a secure and stable connection.
 Perfect-it Paint Finishing System
 Follow sanding and scratch refinement with progressively finer 3M Trizact Hookit discs to remove scratches entirely in step 3 of the 3M Perfect-it Paint Finishing System. Work a 2' x 2' area at a time with a rotary buffer and 3M Perfect-It EX Rubbing Compound and our 3M Perfect-It Low-Linting Wool Compounding Pad. Suggested buffer speed: 1,200 — 1,800 rpm. Our wool pad cuts faster and keeps the surface cooler. Follow up with 3M Perfect-It EX Machine Polish (Step 2) to remove any swirls from the previous step. Finish with 3M Perfect-It EX Ultrafine Machine Polish at a buffer speed of 1,200 — 1,800 rpm to eliminate any fine marks for a perfect finish.

 Evenly-spaced grain features gaps that help debris escape, bolstering abrasive's ability to resist loading
 Poly-cotton backing offers great tensile strength, helping enhance overall abrasive durability
 Heavy X-weight backing does not wear and tear easily, rendering the disc a good match for edgework
 Roloc attachment makes disc to tool attachment swift and easy
 3M Cubitron II Roloc Durable Edge Disc 947A has a name that precedes it. This disc reflects the benefits of Cubitron II and Roloc products — coupling the sharp, consistent cutting action of Cubitron II discs with an easy-to-use Roloc attachment. Built for durability and strength, it's great for edge work, because it stands up to edges without tattering or fraying.
 Built for Low- to Medium-Pressure Applications and Edgework
 3M Cubitron II Roloc Durable Edge Disc 947A was built for low- to medium-pressure applications that require edgework. Its small size makes it nimble and maneuverable, so operators can get in, over and around intricate parts. The dual combination of backing and weight add strength to the disc. In fact, these attributes were chosen carefully, so the disc could withstand wear from edges. The poly-cotton backing is a polyester and cotton blend, which makes it more durable than cotton alone and offers good tensile strength with more water resistance. Among backing weights, an X-weight is heavy, durable and quite stiff. The disc's heavy-weight backing minimizes the likelihood of tearing.
 3M Science, Applied with 3M Precision-Shaped Grain Technology
 So what makes Cubitron II discs desirable? They're engineered to cut fast, run cool and last long. The 3M Cubitron II Roloc Durable Edge Disc 947A features 3M Precision-Shaped Ceramic Grain. This revolutionary technology features triangular shaped ceramic minerals. As those minerals wear during use, they fracture at angles that continually form sharp points. This allows the minerals to keep slicing through the substrate with ease, while helping the grain wear more evenly. Altogether, operators get an ongoing, consistent cut. Moreover, because the triangles are evenly spaced when adhered to the backing, the gaps between them permit dust and debris to escape, minimizing loading. The disc is available in 40, 60, 80 and 120 grit, so operators can choose the grade most fitting for their application.
 Roloc Attachment for Ease of Use
 Another benefit of 3M Cubitron II Roloc Durable Edge Disc 947A is that it features a Roloc attachment system. Roloc attachments were designed to make disc-to-tool connections quicker, faster and more efficient. This particular disc is available in a TSM (metal) or TR (plastic) attachment. With a simple 1/2 twist, operators can secure or detach a disc from a Roloc backup pad (sold separately). With the help of a Roloc attachment, operators may enhance overall productivity.
 Altogether, 3M Cubitron II Roloc Durable Edge Disc 947A was designed with speed and durability in mind — engineered to give you a faster, more consistent cut each and every time.

 The sample collection rings aid in the collection of a liquid sample for measuring free adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in solution.
 Upon activation of the test device, reagent in the cuvette of the test device reacts with ATP collected on the sample collection rings to produce light. The intensity of the light is proportional to the amount of ATP. Measurement of the light requires the use of a 3M Clean-Trace NG Luminometer and the results are displayed in Relative Light Units (RLU). Not intended for consumer use.
 The difference between 3M Clean-Trace Water-Free ATP test results and 3M Clean-Trace Water Plus - Total ATP test results done on the same sample indicate the amount of intact microbial cells in the sample.
 With 3M Clean-Trace Water-Free ATP AQF100, monitoring for contamination is simple with real-time results. Quick detection and confirmation allows immediate corrective action to take place. This product can be used with minimal training to monitor for cleaning effectiveness.",Antiarrythmic purines,51124100,Antiarrythmics and antianginals and cardioplegics and drugs for heart failure,51120000,Drugs and Pharmaceutical Products,51000000

 Wool fibers distribute material evenly and consistently
 Wool nap conforms to contours for even finishing
 3M Hookit attachment system holds pad securely and provides quick disc/pad change-out
 Pads combine with buffers, random orbital tools, and variable speed polishers to produce desired final finish
 We manufacture 3M Finesse-it Knit Buffing Pads with wool fibers knit into a polyester fabric backing for applying Finesse-it Finishing Material or Finesse-it Final Finish. These pads are ideal for buffing automotive OEM, marine, and aerospace coatings. These wool pads are also effective for removing finishing abrasive sand scratches, oxidation, and other paint surface defects.
 The professional's choice for repairing automotive finishes
 We trim the length of the Finesse-it Knit Buffing 85078 pads to 15/16"" making it ideal for compounding and polishing in hard to access areas while the lengthier nap of the 85079 pads provide good conformability over irregular surfaces. Finish results are dependent on specific polish used, coating type, and the tool used. These pads are manufactured with our 3M Hookit attachment system for quick pad mounting and removal and to hold the pad securely in place during use. Hookit buffing pads conveniently and firmly attach to a hook-and-loop backup disc pad (sold separately) on rotary or random orbital tools, can be removed cleanly and easily, and can be re-used again and again for the life of the pad.
 Our line of wool buffing pads are generally more aggressive and easier to control than foam pads. They have a greater available cutting surface area due to the presence of thousands of fibers and these fibers provide faster cutting action than foam pads. Wool fibers hold the polish to provide even distribution of material and require less pressure from the operator. The nap helps wool pads glide and conform to contours, making them easier to control than foam pads. Because of their cutting ability, wool pads are effective for removing sanding scratches and perform best on rotary type buffing tools. Depending on the polish type, individual technique, composition of the coating, and the tool used, finishing with a wool pad may require a follow-up step with a foam pad and polish to remove micro-marring or swirl marks.",Abrasives and abrasive media,31191500,Grinding and polishing and smoothing materials,31190000,Manufacturing Components and Supplies,31000000

 Featuring Consistent Finishes and Operator Comfort
 Flap brushes produce a consistent finish which does not reflect lines commonly attributed with ganged arbor hole discs. Density, pressure and angle determine the ability of the flap brush to remove burrs, oxidation and handling marks. The abrasive brush material provides ventilation which helps dissipate heat and, therefore, runs cooler. This provides consistent finishes without smearing or otherwise discoloring the work piece. Minimal vibration can reduce chattermarks on the workpiece and can lead to less operator and machine fatigue.
 Load-Resistant Construction Boosts Life and Performance
 Standard Abrasives Buff and Blend products are load-resistant to keep you cutting with fresh mineral. The gaps in the open web allow unwanted swarf to escape. Consequently, less debris clogs the abrasive, so the mineral can stay fresh, keep cutting sharp and deliver a consistent cut over the life of the product. As the fibers break down and fresh mineral is exposed, it reduces the likelihood of dull or blunt mineral smearing the surface, contributing to cleaner surfaces and less re-work. Furthermore, manual fatigue that may result from applying heavy pressure to a dull abrasive is reduced.
 The Many Benefits of Standard Abrasives Buff and Blend Products
 Standard Abrasives Buff and Blend products invigorate deburring, cleaning, blending and finishing applications by helping operators reduce finishing steps, minimize costs and achieve greater throughput. Each Buff and Blend product and grade offers unique benefits, so operators can choose from a versatile range of options to ensure superior performance on specific applications.

 3M Headlight Lens Restoration Kit is a collection of professional-grade products assembled specifically for removing the cloudy, yellowed haze that builds up on automotive headlight lenses. Kits use a system of light abrasives to keep vehicles looking great and save money vs. replacing expensive lenses. They include complete directions, 3M Trizact sanding discs, pads, tape and polishes.
 Kits contain masking tape, light sanding discs, wax protectant and more
 Restore Your Headlights Without Replacing Them
 Rather than using ineffective solvents — or spending big on new headlight lenses — you can choose our 3M Headlight Lens Restoration Kits. A complete system of light abrasives, polishes and protectants removes scratches, dirt and oxidization that can appear on your lenses, lowering your vehicle's value and reducing safe driving visibility. You can choose a kit that lets you restore headlight lenses without tools. Or, with just a spray water bottle and a common household drill, you can use the full kit with a complete range of abrasive discs for sanding, finishing and refining to remove discoloration that can cause your headlights, tail lights, fog and directional lights to appear cloudy and yellow — for a fraction of the cost and time of buying and installing new lenses. Each kit includes everything you need to restore two headlight lenses.
 How Does it Work?
 Our 3M Headlight Restoration Kit restores clear plastic lenses in a way that standard cleaners cannot. First, apply our high-performance masking tape to the painted surfaces around the lens you are restoring (some kits include 3M Automotive Masking Tape). Use our progressive system of Trizact abrasive discs to remove yellowing, scratches, dirt, haze, and other material buildup on the plastic lens. With or without a common household drill, our Hookit attachment system makes it easy — just slap the disc onto a pad, and you're ready to go. A choice of Headlight Restoration Kits features our 3M Scratch Remover or 3M Rubbing Compound to achieve maximum shine and clarity. Then, using a soft cloth, apply a light coating of 3M Synthetic Wax Protectant. Remove the masking tape, and you're finished.
 About Our Trizact Abrasives
 The abrasive in our Trizact abrasive discs for headlight restoration is so fine that you can sand across the plastic lenses without worrying about creating scratches or other damaging marks. 3M Trizact abrasives feature microreplication — small 3-dimensional structures are reproduced and then uniformly distributed over the surface of the disc. These patterned, precise mineral structures contain multiple layers of abrasive mineral. As the structures wear, fresh, sharp mineral is exposed. The result is that the abrasive cuts faster, stays sharper longer and allows for precise finish control — it removes the yellowing, dirt buildup and small scratches that can cause haze, without damaging the lens itself.
 Why Do You Need Headlight Restoration?
 Today's vehicles have a greater number of plastic components, from plastic headlight lenses to motorcycle windshields, plastic tail lights, trailer lights and more. Plastic components are great for durability and reducing overall weight, but they can yellow and haze with weather, sun and sand, limiting visibility and diminishing the appearance and value of the vehicle. While the impact on a vehicle's value varies, the dangers in terms of limited visibility are clear: It is a factor in 2.8 million accidents, 23,000 fatal crashes and 2,300 pedestrian deaths each year, according to the Motor Vehicle Lighting Council. Dim headlight bulbs and hazy plastic headlight lenses or surfaces may lead to this reduced visibility, putting you, your passengers and other cars at risk. The AAIA Car Care Council found that 26 percent of the cars it inspected had issues with their lighting system. Millions of cars on the road today have plastic headlight lenses. The problem increases with the age of the lens, and with the average age of cars on the road about 10 years old, the problem is growing. That is why it is important to correct hazy, dull headlights.",Exterior vehicle lighting,25172900,Transportation components and systems,25170000,Commercial and Military and Private Vehicles and their Accessories and Components,25000000

 The Difference Is in the Construction
 One of the characteristics that makes 3M Trizact PSA Film Disc roll 268XA a standout among our other 268XA products is that it has a pressure-sensitive adhesive backing. Equipped with this attachment, attaching 268XA to backup pads and hand blocks becomes as easy as adhering a sticker. By applying a little pressure, operators have an abrasive that’s ready to use, enhancing overall productivity and throughput.
 3M Trizact PSA Film Disc roll 268XA also has a polyester backing, which makes it water resistant. As 268XA is commonly used for applications like wet sanding, it’s helpful to have an abrasive that can be run wet or dry. Moreover, using a lubricant like water can help wash away excess debris, preventing it from discoloring the substrate. While it may be run damp, one of the benefits of the disc is that it requires little water for effective results.
 3M Science, Applied with 3M Microreplication Technology
 3M Trizact PSA Film Disc roll 268XA uses proprietary 3M microreplication technology, encapsulating aluminum oxide mineral inside tiny pyramids. These pyramids are evenly distributed over a polyester backing. While conventionally coated abrasives have erratically spaced mineral, Trizact abrasives focus on uniformity. As pyramids wear, fresh, sharp mineral is exposed to produce a consistent cut and a predictable, fine finish.
 Great Versatility
 3M Trizact PSA Film Disc roll 268XA is available in a range of grades so operators can choose the right grade for their unique application; the lower the A-grade, the finer the grade. So, operators should select a smaller grade, like A5, for a fine finish and a larger grade, like A35, for a coarser finish. Discs are color-coded by grade, to reduce the risk of mistakenly selecting the wrong grade in a sequence.
 Regardless of the grade selected, operators can rely on great performance with 3M Trizact products. Operators turn to 3M Trizact PSA Film Disc roll 268XA to bring workpieces one step closer to a matte, semi-gloss or high gloss finish.
 About the PSA Attachment
 This 3M Trizact PSA Film Disc roll 268XA has a pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) to make for easy abrasive to tool attachment and increased efficiency. The PSA backing works much like a sticker, whereby operators can stick the disc to the tool by applying light pressure.

 How 3M Precision-Shaped Grain Works
 3M Precision-Shaped Grain is designed to continuously fracture to form sharp points and edges that easily ""slice"" through metal. It cuts faster, lasts longer and stays cooler. Conventional ceramic abrasive grain tends to ""plow"" through the metal, causing heat to build up in the workpiece and the abrasive — resulting in a slower cut, shorter belt life and undesirable effects, such as burnishing.
 3M Science. The Beginning of Cubitron II.
 In 2009, 3M scientists had long believed abrasives would work better if each grain of the ceramic abrasive material was exactly the same size and shape. It would act more like a knife shaving off material and less like a plow bouncing along the surface, creating heat damage. The breakthrough came when they realized they could use microreplication technology 3M was already using to create reflective material for signs, and other purposes. Within a short time, they had created 3M's Precision Shaped Grain — identical triangular-shaped abrasive grains electrostatically oriented and distributed uniformly on an abrasive backing. The end result is faster, cooler cutting action, improved productivity, less operator fatigue and longer belt life.

 What is Masking Tape?
 Masking tape was developed specifically to help protect surrounding surfaces from overspray, provide clean paint lines, and remove easily and cleanly when finished. Masking tapes from 3M adhere well, resist solvents or water from the paint, and are strong enough to hang plastic sheeting, yet remove cleanly without damaging the subsurface. The backing, typically crepe paper, can conform to curved and irregular surfaces. The tape hand tears for tool-free application.",Adhesives,31201600,Adhesives and sealants,31200000,Manufacturing Components and Supplies,31000000

 A more environmentally friendly alternative to lead wheel weights
 Unleaded: 3M Does its Part
 Our wheel weights are made from a non-lead composite material. According to the EPA, approximately 1.6 million pounds of lead wheel weights are lost in the United States when they fall off during normal driving conditions. These weights can enter the environment in a variety of ways, including being washed into storm sewers or gathered during street cleaning and disposed of in landfills. A growing number of jurisdictions are introducing and passing legislation that bans the use of lead wheel weights. This lead-free, composite material provides a more environmentally friendly alternative without sacrificing performance. In addition to environmental benefits, 3M Wheel Weights also resist the corrosion that is common with lead weights, which enhances overall tire appearance.",Industrial wheels,31171800,Bearings and bushings and wheels and gears,31170000,Manufacturing Components and Supplies,31000000

 Hookit attachment system allows for fast, easy change outs with Hookit disc pads and soft interface pads
 Our 3M Trizact Hookit Foam Abrasive Disc removes fine sand scratches on painted surfaces to reduce the amount of time spent compounding. Three-dimensional mineral abrasive structures are distributed uniformly across the disc surface and wear evenly for consistent finishes, longer disc life and reduced material costs. Foam backed discs are part of the 3M Perfect-It Paint Finishing System.
 Advanced Abrasives for Collision Repair
 As part of our Perfect-It Paint Finishing System, 3M Trizact Hookit Foam Abrasive Discs help reduce the time and material required for compounding, creating significant operating efficiencies during spot and large panel repairs. Our Trizact abrasives remove fine grade sand scratches while staying sharper longer, reducing material costs. In specific situations, the abrasive allows operators to reduce or eliminate additional materials, like wool compounding pads. They can also save time, reducing and even eliminating entire grade sequences such as compounding for more efficient operations. Foam backing provides plenty of control and consistent contact with the surface, great for preserving orange peel. Trizact Hookit abrasive discs work with our Hookit disc pads and soft interface pads for responsive application and fast, efficient change outs during the paint finishing process.
 Use Trizact 3000 grit foam discs for removing 1200-1500 grade sand scratches, and select Trizact 5000 grit foam discs for removing 3000 grade sand scratches on painted surfaces. Use with 3M Hookit Disc Pad 05551 or 20427 and 3M Hookit Soft Interface Pad 05777 prior to the use of 3M Perfect-It machine polishes and pads.
 About Our Trizact Abrasives
 For more predictable finishes and improved, consistent quality, 3M Trizact products feature 3-dimensional structures that are uniformly distributed over the surface of the abrasive. These patterned, precise mineral structures contain multiple layers of abrasive mineral. As the structures wear, fresh, sharp mineral is exposed. The result is that the abrasive cuts faster, allows for precise finish control, and stays sharper longer — operators can even reduce grade sequences during collision repair, requiring fewer process steps and fewer abrasive products.
 3M Trizact products feature 3-dimensional structures that are uniformly distributed over the surface of the abrasive
 About Our Hookit Attachment System
 The Hookit hook-and-loop feature makes disc attachment, removal, and re-attachment clean and easy, and facilitates use and re-use of the disc for the extent of the abrasive life. Hookit disc pads have J-shaped hooks of the type most commonly used in everyday hook-and-loop applications. Hookit disc pads grip the brushed nylon loop backings of 3M Hookit discs and provide a finer finish than do adhesive backed discs. The Hookit system is designed for work spaces where adhesive backed discs may become contaminated by dust, dirt, or flying debris.

 A Firm Fiberglass Resin that's Easy to Work With
 Bondo Fiberglass Resin Jelly features tiny milled glass fibers that add strength and provide a thicker consistency for filling holes and rust-outs in auto body repair. This formula is ideal for vertical work such as car doors or boat hulls where standard resin can drip down the surface and cause extra work and cleanup. Also, there's no need for fiberglass mats, cloths and backing strips with small holes which cuts down on work time. For repairing larger holes where even more strength is needed, these added materials can be easily used.
 Easy from Mixing to Sanding
 This fiberglass resin jelly filler is easily mixed using the included Bondo Red Cream Hardener , designed specifically for use with Bondo fillers. It also features a fast-drying formula that is sandable in as little as 20 minutes.
 For Auto or Marine
 This waterproof filler is ideal for repairing and filling minor rusted-out holes in metal, wood and automotive fiberglass. It is compatible with most paint systems for cars and boats.
 Use During the Fill Stage of the 3M Body Repair System
 Even a small repair can seem complex at first. So 3M's Body Repair System simplifies the entire automotive body repair process by dividing it into four stages:
 Stage 1 — Prepare. This stage includes pulling dents, removal of paint and rust and efficient, effective masking of the area.
 Stage 2 — Fill. This stage involves patching holes with reinforced filler and smoothing and shaping filler before painting.
 Stage 3 — Paint. This stage includes painting the area and blending and smoothing primer and paint.
 Stage 4 — Finish. The final stage for showroom-grade results: removing small defects, sealing and polishing clear coats and other painted surfaces.
 3M supplies premium products such as abrasives, tapes, body fillers and tools for every stage. This system helps you work easily, efficiently and successfully across the entire body repair process.
 Bringing Science to the Art of Auto Body Repair
 As a brand of 3M, Bondo is well known among collision repair professionals and others who are committed to helping you restore the beauty and value to your cars and boats. This milled fiberglass reinforced resin jelly is another way that 3M applies science to life — and helps you rediscover the excitement of the vehicles you own.

 Headset tension is easily adjusted for head size and comfort by squeezing together or pulling apart the eartubes. Snap-tight, soft-sealing eartips conform to individual ears for an excellent acoustic seal and comfortable fit. Eartips snap firmly onto the ends of the eartubes and, for safety, require a significant effort to remove.
 Resilient next-generation tubing retains its shape and flexibility even after folding tightly into a pocket. It provides longer stethoscope life due to improved resistance to skin oils and alcohol, and is less likely to pick up stains. Next-generation tubing is not made with natural rubber latex, a benefit to sensitive medical professionals and their patients. And, to play its part in the protection of human health and the environment, the next-generation tubing does not contain phthalate plasticizers.
 The Classic II Pediatric stethoscope is made in the USA for consistent quality. It comes complete with large soft-sealing eartips, large firm eartips, and instructions.

 3M Science Eliminates a Source of Lead Contamination
 According to the EPA, approximately 1.6 million pounds of lead wheel weights are lost in the United States when they fall off during normal driving conditions. These weights can enter our environment in a variety of ways, including being washed into storm sewers or gathered during street cleaning and disposed of in landfills. A growing number of jurisdictions are introducing and passing legislation that bans the use of lead wheel weights.

 These pads are designed with our 3M Hookit attachment system for quick pad mounting and removal and to hold each pad securely in place during use. Hookit buffing pads quickly and firmly attach to a hook-and-loop backup disc pad (sold separately) on rotary or random orbital tools, can be removed cleanly and easily, and can be re-used again and again for the life of the pad.
 Wool buffing pads are generally more aggressive and easier to control than foam
 Wool Fibers Distribute Material Evenly and Consistently
 Our line of wool buffing pads are generally more aggressive and easier to control than foam pads. They have a greater available cutting surface area due to the presence of thousands of fibers and these fibers provide faster cutting action than foam pads. Wool fibers hold the polish to provide even distribution of material and require less pressure from the operator. The nap helps wool pads glide and conform to contours, making them easier to control than foam pads. Because of their cutting ability, wool pads are effective for removing sanding scratches and perform best on rotary type buffing tools (PDF, 18.5 Mb). Depending on the polish type, individual technique, composition of the coating, and the tool used, finishing with a wool pad may require a follow-up step with a foam pad and polish to remove micro-marring or swirl marks.
 Provides Soft, Smooth Surface for Applying 3M Finesse-It Finishing Products
 3M Finesse-it products are specially engineered abrasives, compounds, polishes, and buffing pads to be used on OEM and baked refinish paints to remove defects, sand scratches, or swirl marks on a variety of painted surfaces. 3M Finesse-it products are an integral part of our recommended buffing system for repairing surface defects to clear coats, lacquered wood, solid surfaces, gelcoat, powder coat, industrial paint, acrylic, and glass.",Safety control devices,32151800,Automation control devices and components and accessories,32150000,Electronic Components and Supplies,32000000

 Our 3M Stretch Laminator is an excellent solution for helping achieve complete lamination of 3M Acrylic Foam Tapes. For use when laminating tape to automotive substrates that are subject to slight shrinkage, it features a clutch assembly and two idler rollers that stretch the tape slightly using consistent tension. This allows tape to shrink with the substrate, helping eliminate liner buckling.
 3M Stretch Laminator is ideal for automotive substrates that will shrink from 1-2% within the first 24 hours of tape application
 An Excellent Solution for Smooth, Consistent Tape Lamination to Shrinking Substrates
 Specifically designed for use with 3M Acrylic Foam Tapes that require lamination, our 3M Stretch Laminator is ideal for laminating tapes to automotive substrates that will shrink from 1-2% within the first 24 hours of tape application. Use of the stretch laminator can help eliminate buckling of the liner after tape application to maintain a truly smooth, professional appearance even as the substrate shrinks. This durable vertical-mount tool applies uniform, consistent tension to tapes to achieve a light (less than 4%) stretch without liner pop-off or rippling.
 Designed for OEM Attachment Tape Processing
 The design of the 3M Stretch Laminator delivers smooth, even flow of tape through its components, making tape stretching very easy to incorporate into laminated tape application processes. The tape feeds around a clutch roller which is plasma coated so it won't damage the tape surface, and twin idler rollers which are grooved to accept specific tape widths. The clutch is concealed behind a vertical-mount base plate, and ensures consistent tension for a precise tape stretch. The stretch laminator includes an M4 x 20 set screw and all mounting hardware.

 Open web construction resists loading, contributing to longer service life
 Open web responds to surface irregularities without altering geometry of the part
 The Scotch-Brite Clean and Finish Bonded Cleaning Brush is designed for light-duty finishing and oxide or stain removal. This product is made of discs bonded to a steel core, a superior design that makes work safer, quicker and more efficient.
 Bonded and reinforced for extended durability in tough, high-wear, heavy duty applications
 Our Scotch-Brite Clean and Finish Bonded Cleaning Brush has abrasive mineral options of talc, silicon carbide and aluminum oxide and offered in 3, 5, and 7 density: soft to hard. Brushes are offered in varying make-to-order widths — 18 inches to 80 inches.
 When cleaning or finishing sensitive surfaces, it's necessary to ensure that the work surface remains unharmed. Damage clearly undermines quality, making products less aesthetically pleasing or possibly rendering them unusable. We've created an effective tool that allows you to complete necessary cleaning or finishing without damaging the finished product. The brush's construction helps protect the base material, allowing for more effective brush energy transfer and greater control.
 Open web construction offers a number of benefits. The open web construction protects surfaces while resisting particle loading, contributing to a longer abrasive service life. The open web is responsive and adaptable to surface irregularities, effectively finishing or cleaning the surface without altering its geometry. Open web construction also leads to improved user safety. Unlike wire and fiber bristles, the non-metallic, open web construction of Scotch-Brite brushes eliminates sharp wires and bristle fragments flying off the brush.
 abrasive particles are resin-bonded to resilient synthetic fibers
 The Scotch-Brite Advantage
 The Scotch-Brite Clean and Finish Bonded Cleaning Brush is part of an extensive, versatile family of high-performance performance brushes. These products offer an alternative to conventional bristle brushes and messy, technique dependent buffing compounds. Our long-lasting, precision-made cleaning brushes give you improved consistency and greater control over a number of critical metal prep and finishing tasks, including cleaning, stripping, deburring, polishing, aesthetic finishing and more.
 Engineered using proprietary 3M non-woven materials technology, Scotch-Brite brushes are available in a wide range of grades and brush constructions. This gives users the ability to tailor brush performance to your specific application requirements — unlike ""all-purpose"" brushes that may compromise quality, consistency or durability; and because they provide more contact with the work piece than bristle-type brushes, Scotch-Brite brushes last longer and run faster to help you achieve higher throughput.
 Note: When ordering a bonded construction cleaning brush, please allow an additional 1-1/4"" to provide clearance for the 5/8"" lock collars located at both ends of the brush. For instance, if you require 40"" of usable brush width, order a 40"" wide brush. This brush, however, when measured at the core will actually be 41-1/4"" including the lock collars.

 Simplify your packing operations with a proven solution. 3M Water Activated Paper Tape 6147 is an easy, economical solution to a range of basic carton sealing challenges. We designed this light duty, water-activated ""gummed"" adhesive tape to provide a strong seal to a wide variety of corrugated surfaces. A 3-way fiber glass reinforcing pattern in the backing adds strength in all directions.
 Paper construction is easy to handle, making it ideal for hand applications
 When Being Tacky is Good
 3M Water Activated Paper Tape 6147, with our 3-way fiber glass reinforcement and high-tack, water activated adhesive, ensures your corrugated boxes stay sealed until ready for opening. For our 3 way fiber glass reinforcing pattern we lace lengthwise threads with a diamond cross-machine pattern. The lengthwise threads are composed of 75 Denier Fiberglass at 33/64"". The spacing ratio is 2-1-1-1-2. We then cross machine threads using 50 Denier Fiberglass to complete the diamond pattern using slightly less than 1-1/4"" spacing between threads. In tandem with the reinforced virgin kraft paper, our high-tack water activated adhesive system holds the tape in place throughout shipping, handling and storage. The tape is 3"" wide, 8.5 mil thick and is available in natural and white colors.
 We recommend 3M Water Activated Paper Tape 6147 for sealing packages weighing a maximum of 45 lbs. The optimal method for securing a box is to form two C clips on each carton top and bottom. When water-activated, this tape easily and quickly conforms over carton edges and corners to form secure, tamper-evident C clip and I clip seals. Our water-activated, or ""gummed,"" tape is very effective for sealing corrugated cartons, as the adhesive will bond with the fiberboard material to create a strong durable seal and endure the toughest handling and shipping scenarios. Our tape works well on recycled cartons and non-unitized loads. Its reinforced construction assures reliable performance across a range of environments and applications. Our economical packaging tape meets the needs of numerous industries and general industrial applications such as food, beverage, medical pharmaceutical, paper, print, electronics, shipping and distribution centers.
 Choose from either electric or manual dispensing systems
 We also offer semi-automatic application equipment to increase efficiencies and help speed up your packaging needs and carton sealing processes. Application is most easily accomplished at room temperature and once applied; the tape performs well throughout the normal temperature ranges typically encountered by packaged products in shipping and storage environments.
 A Better Way to Seal Corrugated
 3M Water Activated Dispensers and Water Activated Tapes are an easy, economical solution to a wide variety of carton sealing challenges. To create a strong, lasting seal, the moistened adhesive interacts with porous surfaces to form a powerful, secure bond. This tape-bond forms a tamper-evident seal that shreds if an attempt is made to pull it off before delivery. Normally constructed from paper, our taping system is easy to operate, apply, and handle, making it ideal for hand applications.

 Extra heavy, strong F-weight paper backing withstands rugged use, resists tearing
 Best for blending and finishing stainless steel, aluminum and carbon steel
 Good for paint stripping or D/A applications on metal
 Our 3M Hookit Paper Disc 763U combines a blend of ceramic and aluminum oxide abrasive grain and a heavy F-weight paper backing to make short work for tasks like defect repair on metals, prep for paint and orbital sanding. 3M Hookit attachment system makes tool attachment swift and simple.
 3M ceramic aluminum oxide blend abrasive grain on a heavy F wt. paper backing
 Stay Cooler, Cut Faster, Last Longer
 A blend of aluminum oxide and 3M Ceramic Abrasive Grain provides our 3M Hookit Paper Disc 763U with its fast cut and exceptional durability.
 Perfect for moderate to heavy stock removal as well as finishing, ceramic abrasives are engineered to handle intense heat and stress applications. Ceramic/aluminum oxide blends surpass aluminum oxide alone in cut-rate and durability and make an excellent choice for difficult grinding applications. Closed coat construction contributes to higher stock removal and longer life. It is great for final finishing and polishing on metal substrates, as well, because the dense concentration of mineral lays down a finer pattern.
 Available in grades of 60, 80, P100 and P120, 3M Hookit Paper Disc 763U is a premium product that is ideal for work on metal. With a resin bond that is tough and resilient, and paired with the F-weight paper backing, this disc is made to stand up to demanding applications.
 Swift, Simple, Secure Attachment
 Hookit sanding discs conveniently attach to a 3M Hookit Disc Pad (sold separately), can be removed swiftly and easily, and can be re-used again and again for the extent of the abrasive life. It couldn't be simpler to attach a disc, and it stays firmly seated. This disc tends to leave finer finishes than a flatter pressure-sensitive backing, it is more flexible and it resists contamination by dust, dirt, and debris unlike pressure-sensitive adhesive backings
 Recommended Applications
 The 3M Hookit Paper Disc 763U is commonly used for blending and finishing stainless steel, aluminum and carbon steel.

 3M Xtract Paper Disc 216U features a 3M proprietary multi-hole pattern for improved dust extraction in finishing applications. Part of the 3M Xtract Series, designed for optimal dust removal. This innovative multi-hole pattern extracts dust better than 5- or 6-hole products — increasing cut and dramatically increasing disc life. The design does not need to align with the disc pad holes, making switching the discs fast, easy and convenient. Advanced Series Abrasives from 3M are designed to deliver an unbeatable combination of performance and value. Open coat construction and a load-resistant coating further prevent clogging.
 Built Built for Efficient Finishing
 3M Xtract Paper Disc 216U is constructed of aluminum oxide and is suitable for finishing applications on wood as well as primer, paint, sealers, topcoats, fiberglass, and plastics. The 3M Hookit (hook & loop) attachment system makes disc changes fast and easy, meaning the disc can be used again and again for the extent of the abrasive life.
 The Benefits of Aluminum Oxide
 3M chose aluminum oxide abrasive, which is a popular choice among industrial professionals because of its fast cut-rate and long life. This mineral makes a tough, durable abrasive that self-fractures to expose fresh cutting edges in use, whereas traditional abrasives such as garnet quickly wear down with use. Due to their fast cut-rate, hardness, and strength, they are widely used in sanding and finishing applications. Aluminum oxide is suitable for a wide variety of materials in both woodworking and metalworking, including ferrous alloys.
 Efficient Dust Extraction
 Sandpaper discs cut better and last longer when dust isn't loading the cutting surface of the abrasives. Reducing dust is easier than ever with 3M Xtract Discs, designed for optimal dust removal. For maximum dust extraction, use this disc with a 3M Xtract Hookit Back-up Pad and a random orbital sander with vacuum (both sold separately). The 3M proprietary multi-hole pattern on 3M Xtract products removes dust at a higher rate than 5- or 6-hole products. This proprietary multi-hole pattern evacuates dust from the disc at a high rate. This hole design doesn't even require alignment of holes with the disc pad (which is attached to a random orbital sander and sold separately), making disc changes quick and simple. The 3M Hookit attachment system uses a hook and loop design that makes disc changes fast and easy. All of this adds up to improved productivity and reduced material consumption.",Abrasive wheels,31191600,Grinding and polishing and smoothing materials,31190000,Manufacturing Components and Supplies,31000000

 Understanding 3M Scotch-Weld Polyurethane Reactive (PUR) Adhesives
 3M Scotch-Weld PUR Adhesives are one-component, moisture-curing urethane adhesives that are applied warm to create dramatically strong bonds to a variety of substrates such as wood, fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) and many other plastics to themselves, to metal and to glass. Fast-acting strength begins to build as the adhesives cool for rapid, convenient application with minimal downtime from clamping or fixturing. These adhesives can be extruded from hand held or bench mounted 3M Scotch-Weld PUR Adhesive Applicators.
 PURs offer attractive options: from woodworkers searching for thin bond lines and replacing unsightly mechanical fasteners, to plastic, glass and metal materials assembly in automotive, electronics, general assembly and many other industries.

 About Carbon Filtration
 In many filtration applications, carbon is often the preferred media of choice to absorb certain impurities and one of the most powerful absorbents available. Carbon is highly effective due to the vast surface area contained within a small footprint. One pound of carbon contains a surface area of approximately 100 to 125 acres and can absorb an extremely wide range of substances which may be in drinking water.

Because of its thick consistency, our lubricant holds in place without freely dripping away. It even resists washing away when it comes in contact with water through road spray, rain, snow and sleet.
 Benefits of Lubricant
 When you apply this lubricant (PDF, 22 Kb), parts move with less friction and resistance, but they also experience less wear. A coating of lubricant also helps protect metal parts from rust and corrosion.
 Easy Application
 The aerosol can makes targeting the lubricant to the desired location simple and quick. An extension tube is supplied to make targeting tight spots easier.",Packaging cans,24121800,Packaging materials,24120000,Material Handling and Conditioning and Storage Machinery and their Accessories and Supplies,24000000

 Provides improved smoothness and mold release for FKM extrusions and compounds
 Delivers exceptional processing performance with limited property loss
 Exhibits excellent thermal stability
 Ideal for many FKM tube, profile and pre-form extrusions, plus injection and transfer molding
 3M Dynamar High Performance Rubber Additive RA 5300 is designed for use at low loadings to improve the processing in extrusion and molding operations. As a rubber processing additive, RA 5300 can help improve the surface finish of FKM extrusions, deliver a higher yield and improve downstream processing.
 Outperforming Conventional FKM Additives
 3M Dynamar High Performance Rubber Additive RA 5300 exhibits exceptional stability for compression set and heat age resistance compared to conventional fluoroelastomer (FKM) additives, and at loadings less than 1 PHR it has little to no effect on rheological properties. Dynamar high performance rubber additive RA 5300 may also aid molding processes with improved flow, release, and tool fouling, especially at higher molding temperatures (approximately 400F).
 Traditional techniques for mixing FKM compounds can be used to incorporate Dynamar RA 5300. The same properties that allow this product to perform in extrusion and molding processes can also be seen in the mixing process. Sticking to two-roll mills and internal mixers can be lessened with the use of RA 5300.

 The Science Behind How Thinsulate Acoustic Insulation Absorbs Noise
 All sound is transmitted through the air as waves. These acoustic waves oscillate at differing frequencies. When oscillating waves contact the fine fibers of our Thinsulate acoustic insulation, the resulting friction turns their acoustic energy into heat. The heat irreversibly dissipates and reduces sound. As a result, Thinsulate acoustic insulation applied to automotive interiors reduces interior noise for a quieter, more comfortable ride.",Thermoset plastics,13101900,Rubber and elastomers,13100000,Resin and Rosin and Rubber and Foam and Film and Elastomeric Materials,13000000

 We manufacture our 3M Finesse-it Buffing Pad - Orange Foam White Loop for use with our 3M Finesse-it polishes, which are specially designed to achieve satin, semi-gloss or high gloss finishes on wood, automotive, marine, and aerospace coatings.
 3M Finesse-it Buffing Pad - Orange Foam White Loop is ideal for final and extra fine finishing steps for automotive OEM clear coats and removing sand scratches or swirl marks from previous finishing steps. The orange foam buffing pads can also be used in the 3M Finesse-it Trizact Paint Repair System for AOEM paint and clear coats. Our pads are manufactured with the 3M Hookit attachment system for quick pad mounting and removal and to hold them securely in place during use. 3M Hookit buffing pads quickly and firmly attach to a hook-and-loop backup disc pad (sold separately) on rotary or random orbital tools, can be removed cleanly and easily, and can be re-used again and again for the life of the pad. Finish results are dependent on specific polish used, coating type, and the tool used.
 We developed our line of foam pads to address the unique chemical composition of evolving paint and clear coat technologies. Foam pads are generally less aggressive and produce a finer finish than wool pads. They normally operate at higher RPMs than wool pads, relying on a combination of cutting and heat buildup to slightly melt the surface coating and remove fine scratches, swirl marks, and surface marring. Foam pads range in abrasive levels determined by its softness and the cell size of the holes; the larger the hole, the more aggressive the pad. ""Closed cell"" pads are the least aggressive type. You can use our foam buffing pads in conjunction with polishes and are suitable to use with rotary and random orbital tools.
 Our line of 3M Finesse-it products are specially designed compounds and polishes to be used on OEM and baked refinish paints to remove sand scratches or to remove defects, sand scratches, or swirl marks on a variety of painted surfaces. 3M Finesse-it products are an integral part of our recommended buffing system for repairing surface defects to clear coats, lacquered wood, solid surfaces, gelcoat, powder coat, industrial paint, acrylic, and glass.

 Use with Bondo Body Fillers
 Faster, Easier Filler Application
 Unlike putty knives or any of the flat pieces and parts you might use to mix and apply common body fillers, caulks and glazes, our Bondo Spreader is designed specifically for automotive aftermarket applications. Each pack contains 3 different spreader sizes, virtually ensuring you get the spreader that's most comfortable and effective for the specific job. Made from durable plastic, each spreader is strong enough to last yet flexible, giving you all the leverage you need to work effectively across flat or curved surfaces. And each spreader features a thin, clean edge that makes it faster and easier to shape filler, putty, glaze, spackle or caulk just the way you want it.
 Cleans Up in Seconds, Completely Reusable
 Bondo Spreaders continue saving time and money after use. With no joints or seams that can collect putty or filler, single-piece reusable spreaders are easily cleaned — a quick wipe-down with acetone, and they're ready for the next application.

 A Spray System That Pays Off
 The atomizing heads used with the Accuspray HGP Spray Gun are a big part of our 3M Accuspray System for automotive collision repair. Replaceable atomizing heads are see-through so it's easy to see when the head is clean, and the spray guns perform like new every time the atomizing head is replaced — the equivalent of a new spray gun, at a fraction of the cost. The benefits include reduced primer consumption, lower application time and less time for cleanup, plus a better finish which results in less sanding time. The end result: cleaner, more productive, more profitable collision repair operations.
 Accuspray and Our PPS System
 The 3M Paint Preparation System is an all-in-one closed system for mixing/measuring, filtering, sealing and protecting.
 No Need to Spend on Extra Mixing Cups, Filters and Strainers
 This system eliminates the inefficient process of mixing paint and other materials separately and transferring them through filters and other equipment where product gets left behind, unused. Instead, paint and other materials are mixed and sprayed out of the same cup with a PPS liner, lid and built-in filter. You simply place a disposable liner within a re-usable paint cup. Then mix the paint in the PPS liner, snap the disposable lid (with built-in filter) in place and attach the locking collar to complete the PPS System. With just a quick quarter-turn, the assembly easily attaches to the spray gun body. Once you're finished spraying, simply remove the liner from the cup and discard it. It's that simple.
 And each PPS cup can be used for temporary sealing and protection of liquid coating materials for continued use — just use the included sealing plug. This system lets painters mix less paint, drastically reduce their solvent use, and spend less time cleaning spray guns and cups. It even lets them spray in any direction, including upside down, for consistent coverage and improved material usage. All told, the PPS system can improve operator efficiency by as much as 15%, and can save up to 70% on solvent usage alone. All of this adds up to a very clear cost savings across your operation.
 The Science of Better Spray Systems from 3M
 We put decades of scientific and real-life study into our 3M Accuspray HGP Spray Gun Kit to help make hihg-viscosity spray application easier and save collision repair and other professionals time and money at every step.

 Versatile abrasive suits many applications for woodworking and paint prep
 Premium mineral delivers a faster cut and extended life
 Load-resistant coating and open coat construction help prevent dust and debris from clogging the abrasive
 Easy-to-use 3M Stikit attachment system enables quick product change-outs
 We engineered 3M Stikit Film 375L Linered abrasive to deliver outstanding tear resistance, flexibility and consistent finish on a variety of substrates. The film backing conforms to contours and delivers a super smooth application that produces a highly uniform finish. Premium aluminum oxide grain offers a faster cut and extended product life over standard A/O mineral for greater productivity.
 Tear-Resistant Film Achieves Superior Finish
 3M Stikit Film 375L Linered is excellent for a variety of applications. In coarse grades, it is a great choice for demanding applications that require greater durability. For wood finishing, the 375L film in medium grades conforms well to the contours and rounded edges of challenging work surfaces to deliver a superior finish. Woodworking applications are further enhanced by a load-resistant coating and open coat construction, which reduce clogging and extend the life of the abrasive. For pre- and post-paint finishing, versatility is key, and our 375L film in fine grades is designed to deliver a superb uniform finish on plastics and clear coat technologies commonly used in the transportation industry.
 Consistent Results on Many Substrates
 Film-backed abrasives have excellent tear-resistant properties and provide a very uniform finish and consistent results with each use. This makes them an excellent option when working on paint, e-coats, primers, gel coats, glass, acrylics and solid surface material, wood topcoats and anywhere else you need a quality finish every time.
 Faster Cut, Longer Life
 We use premium aluminum oxide abrasive mineral in the manufacture of our 3M Film 375L. Aluminum oxide is a popular choice among industrial professionals because of its fast cut-rate and long life. This mineral makes a tough, durable abrasive that self-fractures to expose fresh cutting edges, whereas traditional natural abrasives dull more quickly. Due to its fast cut-rate, hardness, and strength, it is widely used in grinding applications in addition to sanding and finishing applications. Aluminum oxide is suitable for a wide variety of materials in both woodworking and metalworking, including ferrous alloys.
 Speedy Stikit Attachment
 3M Stikit abrasives come ready to use with a pressure sensitive adhesive coating — simply press the abrasive onto a backup pad and you're ready to go. A time-saver in multi-step processes, the product attaches easily and removes just as cleanly, leaving an uncontaminated surface for the next sheet. A convenient liner prevents the adhesive from becoming dirty and keeps the backing sticky until applied.

 Fast, Permanent Repairs to Bumpers and Other Flexible Parts
 Featuring the long-trusted Bondo brand, our Bondo Bumper Repair Kit contains everything you need to repair car bumpers yourself and get professional-looking results. It features a compound that is ideal for areas where hard fillers can’t provide enough flexibility for permanent repairs. The 2-part flexible compound dispenses evenly and self-mixes from its syringe-style tube, ensuring the correct mix ratio without premixing. It applies directly to rips and cracks in flexible auto parts such as bumpers and bumper covers, affords a working time of 6 minutes and is sandable in 30 miuntes for fast, easy repair and restoration. For filling larger holes, the versatile formula works as a filler; simply apply it into the hole using the included reinforced mesh.
 This material forms durable, permanent repairs that hold up to sanding and readily accept paint. Yet it stays flexible, matching the original functionality of bumpers and other semi-rigid plastic auto panels.
 Our Bondo Bumper Repair Kit also includes:
 3M Sandpaper . Sheets are provided in 80, 180 and 320 grit.
 Bondo Gray Filler Primer. This fast-drying, lacquer-based primer comes in a convenient spray can and is sandable in only 30 minutes, great for filling pinholes and providing a smooth finish over the bumper repair material.
 Bondo Spreader. Highly flexible spreader allows for use on curved or flat surfaces. The clean edge will ensure a consistently smooth finish on any surface. Spreader is reusable and can be cleaned with acetone after use.
 Bondo Tack Cloth. Features a light tack on the surface that removes dust, lint and dirt from bumpers and flexible parts before priming and painting.
 Use During the Fill Stage of the 3M Body Repair System
 Even a small repair can seem complex at first. So 3M's Body Repair System simplifies the entire automotive body repair process by dividing it into four stages:
 Stage 1 — Prepare . This stage includes pulling dents, removal of paint and rust and efficient, effective masking of the area.
 Stage 2 — Fill. This stage involves patching holes with reinforced filler and smoothing and shaping filler before painting.
 Stage 3 — Paint. This stage includes painting the area and blending and smoothing primer and paint.
 Stage 4 — Finish. The final stage for showroom-grade results: removing small defects, sealing and polishing clear coats and other painted surfaces.
 3M supplies premium products such as abrasives, tapes, body fillers and tools for every stage. This system helps you work easily, eficiently and successfully across the entire body repair process.
 Bringing Science to the Art of Auto Body Repair
 This kit bears the trusted Bondo brand name and contains the science of 3M. Here are all the components for professional quality repairs, in a kit that’s fast and easy to use all the way through the process.

 3M Dyneon Fluoroelastomer FC 2182 is an intermediate viscosity copolymer of vinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropylene containing 66% fluorine. Dyneon fluoroelastomer FC 2182 offers broad chemical and temperature resistance for product durability and longevity. Incorporated cure technology may help save time and increase throughput.
 Proprietary Incorporated Cure
 3M Dyneon Fluoroelastomer FC 2182 can be compounded using standard water cooled internal mixers or two-roll mills with standard fillers and ingredients utilized in typical fluoroelastomer formulations. The dry ingredients should be blended before adding to the masticated gum. For best results, Dyneon Fluoroelastomer FC 2182 should be banded on the mill several minutes prior to adding the blended dry ingredients. Once mixed, the compounded stocks have good scorch resistance and storage stability.
 FC 2182 has a number of favorable attributes that make it suitable for use in injection and transfer molding, as well as extrusion applications. This product offers broad chemical and temperature resistance, as well a proprietary incorporated cure that may help save time and increase throughput.

 Efficient Blending, Finishing and Cleaning
 We engineered this gray open-web disc with medium grade silicon carbide grain bonded onto tough, conformable nylon strands to help you achieve a smooth, clean satin finish. The nylon fibers resist heat and won't melt on hot welds. For efficient blending on contoured or irregular surfaces, the Metal Blending Disc has a high level of flexibility that produces consistent results use after use. If the work surface requires broader coverage to reach intricate areas with the outer diameter of the disc, multiple discs can be stacked on a straight shaft tool or bench motor to create a wheel.
 This long-lasting disc is both heat- and load-resistant to stand up to prolonged use. The extended life and efficient performance of durable Scotch-Brite material means operators can complete more pieces in a shorter amount of time.
 Silicon Carbide for a Fine Finish
 The Scotch-Brite Metal Blending disc contains silicon carbide abrasive mineral, a synthetic mineral that is very sharp and commonly used for low-pressure applications such as paint prep. While it breaks down faster than aluminum oxide, it produces a superior finish.
 The Scotch-Brite Advantage
 Scotch-Brite industrial abrasives are unique surface conditioning products with abrasives incorporated into non-woven nylon or synthetic fibers. Combining abrasives with the fibers creates an abrasive system that delivers consistent results for the life of the product. The open-web material runs cool and is load resistant, which keeps the abrasive minerals cutting at high performance by limiting clogging of the fibers. Fibers in the web continually break down with use to reveal fresh mineral for exceptional consistency, superior cut performance, and extremely long service life. From aesthetic finishing to weld blending, deburring, and more, Scotch-Brite abrasives work fast and deliver consistent results, part after part.",Abrasives and abrasive media,31191500,Grinding and polishing and smoothing materials,31190000,Manufacturing Components and Supplies,31000000

 Our fast-cutting Standard Abrasives Aluminum Oxide Cut-Off Wheel accomplishes tough tasks such as cutting through auto body or marine sheet metal, stainless steel tubing and exhaust pipes, or removing clamps, shafts and rusted bolts. It is a good choice for use on stainless steel and mild steel.
 Using a Cut-Off Wheel
 Unlike abrasive discs, which shape or sand objects using the disc surface, cut-off wheels cut through the workpiece using the outer edge of the wheel. Cut-off wheels run on a high speed cut-off tool (sold separately) and must always be used with an ANSI-approved wheel guard for safety. THE TOOL USED MUST NOT EXCEED THE MAXIMUM OPERATING SPEED (MOS) OF THE WHEEL.
 Durable Wheel, Fast Cut
 Aluminum oxide is a popular choice among industrial professionals because of its versatility on different surfaces, fast cut-rate and long life. It is a tough, durable abrasive that self-fractures to expose fresh cutting edges in use. Due to its fast cut-rate, hardness, strength, and low heat retention, aluminum oxide mineral is used in many forms of abrasive products and on a wide variety of materials including ferrous and non-ferrous metals.

 Restore Your Headlights Without Replacing Them
 Rather than using ineffective solvents — or spending big on new headlight lenses — you can choose our 3M Headlight Lens Restoration Kits. A complete system of light abrasives, polishes and protectants removes scratches, dirt and oxidization that can appear on your lenses, lowering your vehicle's value and reducing safe driving visibility. You can choose a kit that lets you restore headlight lenses without tools. Or, with just a spray water bottle and a common household drill, you can use the full kit with a complete range of abrasive discs for sanding, finishing and refining to remove discoloration that can cause your headlights, tail lights, fog and directional lights to appear cloudy and yellow — for a fraction of the cost and time of buying and installing new lenses. Each kit includes everything you need to restore two headlight lenses.
 How Does it Work?
 Our 3M Headlight Restoration Kit restores clear plastic lenses in a way that standard cleaners cannot. First, apply our high-performance masking tape to the painted surfaces around the lens you are restoring (some kits include 3M Automotive Masking Tape). Use our progressive system of Trizact abrasive discs to remove yellowing, scratches, dirt, haze, and other material buildup on the plastic lens. With or without a common household drill, our Hookit attachment system makes it easy — just slap the disc onto a pad, and you're ready to go. A choice of Headlight Restoration Kits features our 3M Scratch Remover or 3M Rubbing Compound to achieve maximum shine and clarity. Then, using a soft cloth, apply a light coating of 3M Synthetic Wax Protectant. Remove the masking tape, and you're finished.
 About Our Trizact Abrasives
 The abrasive in our Trizact abrasive discs for headlight restoration is so fine that you can sand across the plastic lenses without worrying about creating scratches or other damaging marks. 3M Trizact abrasives feature microreplication — small 3-dimensional structures are reproduced and then uniformly distributed over the surface of the disc. These patterned, precise mineral structures contain multiple layers of abrasive mineral. As the structures wear, fresh, sharp mineral is exposed. The result is that the abrasive cuts faster, stays sharper longer and allows for precise finish control — it removes the yellowing, dirt buildup and small scratches that can cause haze, without damaging the lens itself.
 Why Do You Need Headlight Restoration?
 Today's vehicles have a greater number of plastic components, from plastic headlight lenses to motorcycle windshields, plastic tail lights, trailer lights and more. Plastic components are great for durability and reducing overall weight, but they can yellow and haze with weather, sun and sand, limiting visibility and diminishing the appearance and value of the vehicle. While the impact on a vehicle's value varies, the dangers in terms of limited visibility are clear: It is a factor in 2.8 million accidents, 23,000 fatal crashes and 2,300 pedestrian deaths each year, according to the Motor Vehicle Lighting Council. Dim headlight bulbs and hazy plastic headlight lenses or surfaces may lead to this reduced visibility, putting you, your passengers and other cars at risk. The AAIA Car Care Council found that 26 percent of the cars it inspected had issues with their lighting system. Millions of cars on the road today have plastic headlight lenses. The problem increases with the age of the lens, and with the average age of cars on the road about 10 years old, the problem is growing. That is why it is important to correct hazy, dull headlights.",Abrasives and abrasive media,31191500,Grinding and polishing and smoothing materials,31190000,Manufacturing Components and Supplies,31000000

 Reduces overall pipe diameter requiring fewer and smaller ships for transportation
 Decreases weight and increases buoyancy for lower density in finished parts
 Provides excellent water and oil resistance for use in underwater applications
 Decreases thermal conductivity in syntactic foam compositions
 Good strength-to-density ratio for use in a variety of oil and gas applications
 3M Glass Bubbles S35 are hollow glass spheres with a typical density of 0.35g/cc and an isostatic crush strength of 3,000 psi. These glass bubbles are used in many applications including thermoplastics and deep water wet pipe insulation in oil and gas drilling. The bubbles produce strong, stable voids and low thermal conductivity, helping coatings achieve the necessary compressive strength.
 What are 3M Glass Bubbles?
 3M Glass Bubbles are engineered hollow glass microspheres made from water-resistant and chemically-stable soda-lime borosilicate glass. Like all 3M glass bubbles, our 3M Glass Bubbles S35 are water and oil resistant, providing better utility in underwater applications. Additionally, they are non-combustible and non-porous, so they do not absorb resin; and their low alkalinity makes this product compatible with most resins while providing a stable viscosity and a long shelf-life.
 These low-density particles are used for many demanding applications across a wide range of industries to provide temperature and pressure resistance, reduce part weight, lower costs and enhance overall product properties. For these reasons, 3M glass bubbles are a superior alternative to many conventional fillers and additives such as silica, calcium carbonate, talc and clay.
 Learn more about 3M Glass Bubbles (PDF, 1.2 Mb)
 Strength-to-Weight Ratio
 The benefits don't end there; although 3M glass bubbles S35 have thin walls, they have a good isostatic crush strength of 3,000 psi, meaning they can survive both the rigorous demands of processing and enormous water pressure at depth. In turn, their low thermal conductivity makes them ideal additives in insulation for pipelines and production risers — helping to ensure that hot oil continues to flow to the surface rather than cooling and slowing. S35 bubbles have a fractional survival rate of 80% of more, at 3,000 psi for consistent performance and greater survivability.
 Higher filler loading
 Lower Viscosity
 Deep Water Wet Pipe Insulation
 Of the many functions 3M glass bubbles S35 can perform, they stand out for their frequent use in oil and gas applications. Some flowline construction methods, such as pipe-in-pipe, are proving to be impractical and too costly for use at today's deeper depth oil and gas drilling (10,000 ft. /3,000 m. and more). Although pipe-in-pipe offers the best U-value (insulating value) and longest cool-down times, the added weight and bulk of its construction can make it more difficult and costly to lay — and too heavy to support in deeper waters, which is of particular concern when using drilling risers.
 Importantly, there are some peripheral subsea hydrocarbon reservoirs that are economically viable at reach-out distances of 31 miles (50 km), or more. Longer subsea pipe lengths coupled with hotter drilling conditions require flowline insulation with increased mechanical strength and reduced heat transfer. 3M glass bubbles provide the solution to this drilling need. Using glass bubbles in deep water wet pipe insulation creates a pipeline that can stand up to demanding depth, pressure and temperature conditions.
 Consider the benefits of alternatives such as wet insulated pipe or flexible insulated flowlines. Both options consist of a single pipe coated with 3M glass bubble-filled syntactic foam insulation coatings, such as syntactic urethane. These pipes are less than half the weight of pipe-in-pipe, making them more practical for use at greater depths and in longer runs. Additionally, because this construction reduces overall pipeline diameter, more pipe can be wound per spool, requiring fewer and smaller ships — making installation faster, easier and more economical. Because of these, and many other factors, wet pipe insulation now accounts for the majority of all new deep water subsea flowlines.
 Pushing the Limits: a Proud History of Innovation
 Hollow glass bubble technology was developed by 3M in the 1960s. Riser buoyancy modules and wet pipe flowline insulation using the first glass bubble-filled syntactic foams were capable of surviving down to 5,000 feet below sea level. Today, advancements in the strength-density ratio of glass bubbles enables these materials to be used at any depth — all the way to the bottom of the ocean — more than 36,000 feet (10,972 meters).

 Understanding Epoxy Adhesives
 Epoxy adhesives are part of the class of adhesives called ""structural adhesives,"" which include polyurethane, acrylic, cyanoacrylate and others. Epoxies are formulated as liquid reactive polymers that undergo a chemical reaction when mixed and then cure to form a solid plastic material. Once the two parts are mixed in their specified ratio, they begin the curing process and offer a limited working time where the adhesive can be applied and the two surfaces positioned as needed. This work life lasts anywhere from a few minutes to several hours. These structural adhesives provide high shear and peel strengths, depending on the formula, and better heat and chemical resistance than other common adhesives. In general, epoxy adhesives have the highest overall strength and offer the best performance and most resistance to high temperatures, solvents and outdoor weathering.
 Epoxy adhesive (often referred to as epoxy glue) is widely used in building and home construction; aircraft and automobile manufacturing; bicycle, boat, golf clubs, ski and snowboard assembly as well as a host of home use and other applications. It is used virtually anywhere high-strength bonds are needed along with resistance to environmental conditions. These adhesives are popular for their ease of use, mechanical strength and chemical resistance. Formulations can be created to make epoxy for plastic flexible or epoxy for metal rigid, epoxy resin transparent or opaque, quick setting or slow setting. The versatility with which these adhesives can be formulated helps meet almost any requirement for bonding wood, metal, glass, stone and various plastics.

 X-weight polyester/cotton backing withstands aggressive sanding and grinding
 Resin bonding resists thermal and chemical deterioration for extended wheel life
 Abrasive flap design provides a soft and smooth cut on rounded or irregular surfaces
 Flaps wear down to expose fresh abrasive mineral, assuring a fast and consistent cut
 Our 3M Flap Wheel 741A was designed for light grinding, blending, deburring, and polishing on a variety of metals. Ceramic abrasive covered flaps conform to the work piece and provide a smooth clean finish.
 Metal Finishing Application
 Mixed Ceramic Abrasive
 Each flap on the 3M Flap Wheel 741A is covered with a ceramic abrasive mix, which was designed using a proprietary process to enhance toughness and hardness of the grain. For increased performance, this mix features aluminum oxide blended with 3M ceramic grain to create a harder, longer-lasting abrasive. Perfect for light to moderate stock removal, ceramic abrasives are engineered to cut fast and handle intense heat and stress applications. Ceramic/aluminum oxide blend surpasses aluminum oxide abrasives in cut-rate and durability and makes 3M Flap Wheel 741A an excellent choice for moderate stock removal and surface preparation.
 Tough Construction
 The abrasive mix is attached to a flexible backing using a resin bond. This resin bonding material is specially designed to resist thermal and chemical deterioration, which can occur during high speed sanding. This bond is very hard which allows for faster cuts and a higher cut rate. Each flap uses an X-weight polyester/cotton backing, which provides a tough, but flexible surface that bends to fit any work piece. As the wheel is used, the self-cutting flaps wear away to expose sharp, new abrasive material, assuring that surfaces are sanded consistently throughout the life of the wheel.
 Flap Wheel Design
 Coated Abrasive flap wheels are the ideal choice for light grinding, blending, graining and scale removal on a variety of metals. The abrasive flaps offer a long lasting supply of fresh abrasives and a load resistant design.

 The 3M Perfect-It Brand: 3M's Highest-Quality Solution for Finishing Coated Surfaces
 Our Perfect-It brand represents a complete range of solutions designed for busy shops to achieve perfect defect-free finishes, every time, in as little time as possible. Perfect-It brand products have been developed according to a step-by-step system — there's no need to create your own processes to get the best finish. Premium product performance means shorter process times at every step. You use less material, and you have less material to clean up. In all, our Perfect-It brand products let you complete more jobs in the same amount of time. You get better throughput, the finest and most consistent finishes, and increased customer satisfaction with every job.
 About Our Trizact Abrasives
 For more predictable finishes and improved, consistent quality, 3M Trizact products feature microreplication — small 3-dimensional structures are reproduced and then uniformly distributed over the surface of the abrasive. These patterned, precise mineral structures contain multiple layers of abrasive mineral. As the structures wear, fresh, sharp mineral is exposed. The result is that the abrasive cuts faster, allows for precise finish control, and stays sharper longer — operators can even reduce grade sequences during collision repair, requiring fewer process steps and fewer abrasive products.

 The Forsus Fatigue Resistant Device, now with more than ten years of clinical use and over one million patients treated, overcomes these concerns and limitations.
 Increased Versatility with Three Installation Options
 Forsus L-pin Module
 The L-pin module allows for more flexible installation options and movement in the mouth. It can be used with a gingival or occlusal headgear tube. The left and right sides are universal. It is also used with the Forsus Wire Mount, permitting installation without a molar tube.
 Forsus Fatigue Resistant Device EZ2 Module
 The EZ2 module allows for more consistent installation and automatically prevents the spring from pivoting toward the cheek. The EZ2 module can be used only with an occlusal headgear tube and has permanently marked indicators for the left and right sides.

 Discs can be attached to a straight grinder or right angle grinder using a 3M #990 or #991 mandrels (sold separately)
 Plastic abrasive particles and unique bristle design lightly remove sealant without compromising integrity of the part
 Replaces the need for sealant-removing compounds
 Small size and portable design of disc makes it easier to achieve sealant removal in hard-to-reach areas
 Our Scotch-Brite SR Radial Bristle Disc has sharp plastic abrasive particles interspersed on flexible, spring-like bristles that conform to the substrate. The sharp cutting action and flexibility of Radial Bristle Discs make them a great match for light seam sealant removal.
 Removes Unwanted Coatings
 When used at recommended operating speeds, our Scotch-Brite SR Radial Bristle Disc removes thin layers of sealants, silicones, RTVs and adhesives from most surfaces without removing the underlying paint or coating. Bristle products have no hard edges the way other wheel products do, so they can be compressed to fit into curves and hollows without inducing damaging gouges and trails on the work piece.
 Conforms to the Substrate
 The Scotch-Brite SR Radial Bristle Disc has flexible bristles that conform to the part, creating an incredibly uniform finish even around protrusions, detail grooves, patterns and other hard-to-reach areas. It replaces hand scraping, which means less operator fatigue and less time spent on rework. The SR Radial Bristle Disc also eliminates the need for harsh chemicals, which means there's no need for specialized ventilation or cleanup equipment. Both the 3M SR Cutter and the SR Radial Bristle Disc remove sealants from substrates. However, the SR Cutter is designed to remove thick coatings while the SR Radial Bristle Disc is designed to remove thin coatings.
 Roloc Attachment for Easy Swap Out of Discs
 Our Scotch-Brite SR Radial Bristle Disc comes with Roloc attachment accessories, including plastic Roloc buttons and holders. These buttons and holders were designed to make fastening the disc to portable hand tools like right angle grinders and straight grinders quick and easy. With 1/2 turns, operators can quickly attach or detach the disc to the grinder, making for fast changeouts between discs. The Scotch-Brite SR Radial Bristle Disc can also be used with a variety of 3MMandrels to adjust widths and tailor the size to meet project needs. Minimal pressure and force is needed with Bristle Discs - the aggressive cutting action, responsive bristle design and power of the tool combine to do the work for you.
 An Alternative to Compounds and Hand Scraping
 Critical maintenance and repair tasks often depend on effective seam sealant removal. This task is often an integral part of every mechanic's job. Until now, there were limited choices for removing seam sealant. One was to use chemical solvents, which raise health, safety and environmental concerns. Solvents take time to work, and can be messy to clean up. The other choice for removing seam sealant was hand scraping, which is slow, expensive, and inconsistent. Scraping by hand may also lead to repetitive-motion stress injuries. In addition, some scraping tools can damage the surfaces under the seam sealant. Wire brushes, for example, can aggressively cut aluminum and weaken the integrity of the part. With our Scotch-Brite SR Radial Bristle Disc, operators can safely and effectively remove sealants while still maintaining the integrity of the part.",Tool attachments and accessories,27112800,Hand tools,27110000,Tools and General Machinery,27000000

 Use During the Fill Stage of the 3M Body Repair System
 Even a small repair can seem complex at first. So 3M's Body Repair System simplifies the entire automotive body repair process by dividing it into four stages:
 Stage 1 — Prepare. This stage includes pulling dents, removal of paint and rust and efficient, effective masking of the area.
 Stage 2 — Fill. This stage involves patching holes with reinforced filler and smoothing and shaping filler before painting.
 Stage 3 — Paint. This stage includes painting the area and blending and smoothing primer and paint.
 Stage 4 — Finish. The final stage for showroom-grade results: removing small defects, sealing and polishing clear coats and other painted surfaces.
 3M supplies premium products such as abrasives, tapes, body fillers and tools for every stage. This system helps you work easily, efficiently and successfully across the entire body repair process.

 What is Masking Tape?
 Masking tape was developed specifically to help protect surrounding surfaces from overspray, provide clean paint lines, and remove easily and cleanly when finished. Masking tapes from 3M adhere well, resist solvents or water from the paint, and are strong enough to hang plastic sheeting, yet remove cleanly without damaging the subsurface. The backing, typically crepe paper, can conform to curved and irregular surfaces. The tape hand tears for tool-free application.
 A masking tape should specify what surfaces it will stick to and the interval over which it will remove cleanly. A very thin or poorly manufactured tape may demonstrate splintering or shredding, either coming off the roll or when being removed after use. Some masking tapes have the tensile strength for light commercial and industrial applications, including bundling, labeling, sealing, temporary repairs, lane marking, splicing, and surface protection. From wide to narrow, single rolls to bulk, there are many options to choose from when ordering masking tape. The classic crepe paper masking tape is a light tan color, but masking tapes from 3M come in a variety of colors and formulations to meet general and specific applications. From wide to narrow, single rolls to bulk, there are many options to choose from when ordering masking tape. A roll of masking tape is a basic toolbox or supply room item in construction, warehousing, military, marine, shipping, automotive aftermarket, general manufacturing and retail industries.",Natural rubber,13101500,Rubber and elastomers,13100000,Resin and Rosin and Rubber and Foam and Film and Elastomeric Materials,13000000

 Lighter Vehicles. Thinsulate acoustic insulation products are made from lightweight polyester and polypropylene non-woven fibers.
 Easy to Install. Lightweight and easy to handle compared fiberglass, shoddy, felt and PET.
 Mold, Mildew and Moisture Resistant. Install just the insulation — there's no need for an additional waterproof layer during application. Thinsulate acoustic insulation is also resistant to mildew growth, reducing the risk of offensive odors.
 Efficient Assembly. Attach our acoustic insulation using a variety of methods including ultrasonic welding, double-sided tape or mechanical clips.
 Manufacturing Support. Thinsulate acoustic insulation is supported by a global network of 3M experts. Custom die cutting services are available.
 The Science Behind How Thinsulate Acoustic Insulation Absorbs Noise
 All sound is transmitted through the air as waves. These acoustic waves oscillate at differing frequencies. When oscillating waves contact the fine fibers of our Thinsulate acoustic insulation, the resulting friction turns their acoustic energy into heat. The heat irreversibly dissipates and reduces sound. As a result, 3M Thinsulate Acoustic Insulation applied to automotive interiors reduces interior noise for a quieter, more comfortable ride.

 Small particle size
 Best strength to density ratio
 Newest technology
 Prevents or minimizes fluid loss/lost circulation and formation damage
 The 3M Glass Bubbles HGS7K32 is used for down hole applications for cementing and drilling fluids.
 What are Glass Bubbles?
 3M Glass Bubbles HGS Series are engineered hollow glass spheres made from water-resistant and chemically-stable soda-lime-borosilicate glass. The use of our HGS series glass bubbles, as density reducing agents in well construction applications, offer the potential for:
 Reduced Non-Productive Time (NPT)
 Improved well integrity
 Increased well productivity
 When drilling and cementing across highly depleted zones and weaker formations, low density systems are required to prevent or minimize fluid loss/lost circulation, formation damage and other problems associated with excessive overbalance conditions. Glass bubbles from 3M offer stability by maintaining target pressures with greater reliability throughout the drilling process. Minimizing the differential pressure (bottom hole pressure minus reservoir pressure) is essential for the success of any drilling operation.
 Glass Bubbles in Cementing
 When added to light weight cement slurries, glass bubbles HGS7K32 help prevent problems associated with excessive overbalance, including reduced top of cement (TOC) and thus the need for remedial squeeze. Additional benefits include the potential for:
 Reduced wait-on-cement
 Reduced need for multi-staging
 When compared with other microspheres, cementing with HGS7K32 glass bubbles in shallow to intermediate depth wells offers:
 Consistency batch-to-batch and location-to-location
 Greater density reduction capacity (cement slurry density values below 9 lb/gal (1.1 Kg/l) have been achieved)
 Glass Bubbles in Completion and Workover Fluids
 The use of light weight completion and work-over fluids made with glass bubbles HGS7K32 help reduce and control the bottom-hole pressure, offering the potential for reduced fluid loss and lost circulation — as well as preventing or minimizing formation damage. Our glass bubbles in completion and workover fluids are:
 More economical and allow for a greater density reduction window than synthetic oils
 Compatible with both water based and oil based systems
 Resistant to harsh downhole conditions
 Repeated Use Increases Efficiency, Saves Money
 The durability also allows for possible reconditioning and reuse of lightweight fluid to help reduce costs; this is achieved with our glass bubbles HGS7K32 — an economical product that is compatible with both water and oil based systems. The durability also allows for possible reconditioning and reuse of lightweight fluid to help reduce costs. The tiny bubbles remain dispersed in water, or oil-based control fluid for repeated use.",Commercial marine craft,25111500,Marine transport,25110000,Commercial and Military and Private Vehicles and their Accessories and Components,25000000

 Lower frictional losses improve motor efficiency
 Extended bearing service life
 High temperature capability (650F)
 Operates in oil process fluid or contaminated lubricants
 3M Hydrodynamic Thrust Bearings are designed for demanding electrical submersible pumps (ESPs). The bearing faces are separated by a fluid film, which minimizes wear and significantly decreases bearing frictional losses.
 Minimizing Wear and Frictional Losses
 In electrical submersible pumps, thrust bearings are exposed to a number of challenging downhole conditions, including high shock loads, misalignment and abrasive lubrication. 3M Hydrodynamic Thrust Bearings are designed to minimize wear and frictional losses.
 High Strength for Improved Performance
 3M hydrodynamic thrust bearings are made from 3M Silicon Carbide, a high-strength technical ceramic with excellent resistance to high temperatures, corrosion and abrasion. The intrinsic strength of this material, coupled with patented spring mount technology, delivers outstanding shock absorption and high load capacity.
 In addition, 3M technologies maximize load capacity by allowing pads to both tilt at an optimal angle and flex axially, equally distributing thrust load among pads.
 The Power of Ceramics
 Silicon carbide’s high abrasion resistance allows manufacturers to design process lubricated systems where environmental concerns restrict the use of lubrication. This same capability – when used in oil lubricated applications – increases equipment reliability in the event of seal failure.

 Restore Your Headlights Without Replacing Them
 Rather than using ineffective solvents — or spending big on new headlight lenses — you can choose our 3M Headlight Lens Restoration Kits. A complete system of light abrasives, polishes and protectants removes scratches, dirt and oxidization that can appear on your lenses, lowering your vehicle's value and reducing safe driving visibility. You can choose a kit that lets you restore headlight lenses without tools. Or, with just a spray water bottle and a common household drill, you can use the full kit with a complete range of abrasive discs for sanding, finishing and refining to remove discoloration that can cause your headlights, tail lights, fog and directional lights to appear cloudy and yellow — for a fraction of the cost and time of buying and installing new lenses. Each kit includes everything you need to restore two headlight lenses.
 How Does it Work?
 Our 3M Headlight Restoration Kit restores clear plastic lenses in a way that standard cleaners cannot. First, apply our high-performance masking tape to the painted surfaces around the lens you are restoring (some kits include 3M Automotive Masking Tape). Use our progressive system of Trizact abrasive discs to remove yellowing, scratches, dirt, haze, and other material buildup on the plastic lens. With or without a common household drill, our Hookit attachment system makes it easy — just slap the disc onto a pad, and you're ready to go. A choice of Headlight Restoration Kits features our 3M Scratch Remover or 3M Rubbing Compound to achieve maximum shine and clarity. Then, using a soft cloth, apply a light coating of 3M Synthetic Wax Protectant. Remove the masking tape, and you're finished.
 About Our Trizact Abrasives
 The abrasive in our Trizact abrasive discs for headlight restoration is so fine that you can sand across the plastic lenses without worrying about creating scratches or other damaging marks. 3M Trizact abrasives feature microreplication — small 3-dimensional structures are reproduced and then uniformly distributed over the surface of the disc. These patterned, precise mineral structures contain multiple layers of abrasive mineral. As the structures wear, fresh, sharp mineral is exposed. The result is that the abrasive cuts faster, stays sharper longer and allows for precise finish control — it removes the yellowing, dirt buildup and small scratches that can cause haze, without damaging the lens itself.
 Why Do You Need Headlight Restoration?
 Today's vehicles have a greater number of plastic components, from plastic headlight lenses to motorcycle windshields, plastic tail lights, trailer lights and more. Plastic components are great for durability and reducing overall weight, but they can yellow and haze with weather, sun and sand, limiting visibility and diminishing the appearance and value of the vehicle. While the impact on a vehicle's value varies, the dangers in terms of limited visibility are clear: It is a factor in 2.8 million accidents, 23,000 fatal crashes and 2,300 pedestrian deaths each year, according to the Motor Vehicle Lighting Council. Dim headlight bulbs and hazy plastic headlight lenses or surfaces may lead to this reduced visibility, putting you, your passengers and other cars at risk. The AAIA Car Care Council found that 26 percent of the cars it inspected had issues with their lighting system. Millions of cars on the road today have plastic headlight lenses. The problem increases with the age of the lens, and with the average age of cars on the road about 10 years old, the problem is growing. That is why it is important to correct hazy, dull headlights.",Tape,31201500,Adhesives and sealants,31200000,Manufacturing Components and Supplies,31000000

 3M Fire Barrier Mortar is a lightweight, gypsum-based powder that mixes with water to form a heat-absorbing firestop for through penetrations in fire-rated floor or wall assemblies. Versatile mortar can be mixed self-leveling or non-sag, and adheres to a range of construction substrates and penetrants. It also acts as a heat sink, reducing the chance of fire on unexposed sides of the assembly.
 Versatile and Heat Resistant Mortar
 For mechanical and electrical through penetrations where the penetrants may generate heat, our 3M Fire Barrier Mortar (PDF, 279.8 Kb) provides a ready-to-mix solution. The firestop mortar (PDF, 400 Kb) comes ready to mix with potable water, making it fast and cost-effective. Our mortar can be mixed to a thinner consistency for self-leveling applications such as floors, or as a non-sag material for vertical walls. It adheres well to range of common construction materials including concrete, metals, wood, plastic and cable jacketing.
 The mortar is pumpable as well, resulting in faster work times and lower labor costs. It cleans easily with water. Polypropylene-fiber reinforced material reduces cracking during cure time. The cured material is paintable after priming. It is also re-enterable, allowing technicians to easily access components after installation with a common hole saw. This mortar contains no asbestos, halogens, Portland cement or MMMF and requires no fibrous damming materials or procedures.
 3M Fire Barrier Mortar is firestop tested up to 3 hours in accordance with ASTM E 814 (UL 1479) and CAN/ULC-S115 when installed in listed systems, including 2-1/2"" (63.5 cm) minimum thickness concrete floors. It is also tested in accordance with AS1530.4, EN1366 and ASTM E814 (UL Listed) and has proven self-bonding during fire testing.
 Recommended Applications
 Firestopping and sealing mechanical and electrical service penetrations
 Blank openings and large annular spaces
 Floors and other applications requiring self-leveling material

  Reliable holding power for bundling and reinforcing.
  Stick with extra strength
  When you need high-strength tapes that hold and keep holding, even when scuffed or nicked, look to 3M. Our Scotch Filament Tapes include continuous fibers reinforcing the carrier to make it stronger, help resist damage and stop tears from migrating across the tape. We offer a variety of tensile strengths and different adhesives designed for demanding situations, from hand-breakable economy-grade filament tapes to the strongest filament tape in the world, Scotch Filament Tape 890HD, twice as strong as the nearest competition.
  Bundling/strapping
  Itâ€™s easy to hold a bundle that just sits there â€“ you need it to stay together through every bump and jolt. Scotch Filament Tapes are strong to stay in one piece and bond multiple surfaces to keep your pieces together.
  Coil tabbing/splicing
  You need confidence your tabs and splices will stay together. Scotch Filament Tapes have a strong carrier with excellent adhesive performance to withstand the spring force of a metal coil in aluminum, steel, stainless steel or copper production without damaging the product, minimizing scratches and increasing yield.
  Temporary holding
  Whether youâ€™re dealing with parts, doors or drawers, you need things to stay in place until they reach their destination. Scotch Filament Tapes hold firm, then remove cleanly to minimize cleanup.
  L-clip/fulfillment
  You want your product to arrive safely even through a rough journey. L-clips of Scotch Filament Tape hold firmly to packaging materials even when theyâ€™re slightly crushed in shipping so your customers know everything arrived intact.
  Let us assist in finding you the right filament tape for your needs.

L’ASM se compose d’une membrane en fibre creuse installée dans une enveloppe métallique sous pression. La membrane permet de générer de l’azote à l’intérieur des réservoirs de carburant afin de faire baisser le taux d’oxygène et ainsi de protéger des risques d’explosion.
 Bénéfices clés
 Système breveté
 Intégration simple et flexible
 Pas de calibrage ni de logistique
 Maintenance réduite
 Durée de vie de l'ASM améliorée
 Principe de fonctionnement
 La membrane développée par Air Liquide a été conçue pour répondre aux normes de poids et de fiabilité imposées par un environnement aéronautique pour les systèmes de protection de réservoir de carburant (FTPS - Fuel Tank Protection System). La perméabilité de la membrane dépend directement de la pression et de la température environnante.
 Intégrée sur un OBBIGS (On-Board Gas Generating System), la membrane permet de produire de l’azote à partir de l’air qui se trouve autour de l’avion. Elle est constituée de dizaines de milliers de fibres creuses en polymère de la taille d’un cheveu. Lorsque l’air entre dans la membrane, il est dirigé dans les fibres creuses. Tandis que l’oxygène passe à travers les parois de ces fibres et s’évacue, l’azote traverse entièrement les fibres. A la fin du processus il reste seulement de l’azote pur à 99% . L’azote est ensuite envoyé dans les réservoirs afin de remplacer l’oxygène et ainsi de limiter les risques d’inflammation du carburant. Ce système permet ainsi d’ assurer la sécurité des membres de l’équipage et des passagers .
 Fonctionnement de l'ASM
 Le Groupe développe depuis 1989 des membranes pour de multiples applications : aéronautique, pharmaceutique, chimie, électronique. Air Liquide a été pionnier pour l'utilisation de membranes perméables sur les avions commerciaux en travaillant avec la FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) à l'amélioration de la sécurité des système carburant dès 1996 suite à l'incident d'avion de la TWA 800.
 Des millions d’heures d’expérience ont permis à Air Liquide de développer des fibres en polymères extrêmement performantes pour proposer la meilleure solution possible à ses clients. Le design et la fabrication de la fibre sont optimisés pour atteindre une meilleure productivité et une plus grande pureté de l’azote .
 Caractéristiques techniques
 Optimisé pour le maintien de la fibre et la distribution du gaz, l'uniformité des pressions d'entrée, la bonne répartition des efforts mécaniques

L'avantage de la dose pulsée est que l'oxygène n'est consommé que pendant la partie inhalation, ce qui permet de réaliser des économies de volume.
 Bénéfices
 Simplicité d'utilisation
 L'oxygène n'est consommé que pendant l'inhalation, lorsque l'oxygène est un avantage, une quantité réduite d'oxygène est nécessaire, ce qui signifie une performance extrêmement économique et une économie de poids conséquente.
 Combine une grande autonomie (jusqu’à 5,7 fois plus en débit pulsé qu’en débit continu) et une faible masse
 Peut être utilisé pour des applications d'urgence (débit constant de 2 et 4 litres par minute).
 Principe de fonctionnement
 La série DE comporte 5 réglages d'impulsion avec des réglages de débit constant de 2 ou 4 litres par minute. Le système comprend une bouteille légère homologuée DOT, disponible en 3 tailles : 2,0, 2,7 et 3,2 litres avec une pression de service de 200 bars.
 Le conservateur offre des performances extrêmement économiques, libérant un bolus d'oxygène dès qu'il enregistre une petite chute de pression dans le nez du passager. Il se referme alors très rapidement, conservant ainsi l'oxygène. Le détendeur est de conception robuste et intègre un certain nombre de dispositifs de sécurité. La ""cage"" est fabriquée dans un matériau ignifuge et est conçue pour protéger le détendeur et le conservateur et pour faciliter la manipulation de la bouteille d'oxygène.
 Un sac conçu avec un matériau ignifuge comprend un mode d'emploi, une canule, un masque et des boucles de fixation. Les canules peuvent être fournies avec un indicateur de débit en ligne, ce qui permet au personnel de cabine de vérifier la distribution d'oxygène sans déranger les passagers.

The biomethane is, therefore, sold directly by Air Liquide, which saves you from doing all the administrative, commercial and regulatory formalities.
 We guarantee a biogas buyback rate based on the quality produced. The technical and financial risks for you, related to the sale of biogas, are minimized.
 Before being injected into the natural gas grid, biogas must undergo a complex upgrading process. First, all of its pollutants are removed (O2, H2O, H2S, etc.) as well as one of its main components: carbon dioxide (CO2). The biogas, thereby enriched in biomethane, meets the criteria for being added to the natural gas network.
 In order to allow you to concentrate on your core business while developing your revenue, Air Liquide offers to acquire the purifier and/or liquefier, to pay for its construction and operation, as well as managing the sale the biomethane.
 This offer ensures you maximize the return on your biomethane.

 OBIGGS
 Based on a hollow fiber separation process, the OBIGGS allows to produce during the mission the flow of Nitrogen Enriched Air (NEA) requested to protect the helicopter. Part of the oxygen contained in the fuel tank is replaced by Nitrogen, keeping the vapours non-flammable.
 The OBIGGS includes a Temperature Control System, a filter, a pressure controller, an oxygen sensor and a separation module. Hence, compressed air is directly tapped on Helicopter engine air and transformed into NEA that can be directly distributed in the fuel tanks. Compact, the Air Liquide OBIGGS can be easily installed on the Helicopter. Besides, Air Liquide can support the customer to design the distribution system: Inerting modelling, piping sizing, supply of distribution components. The use of the OBIGGS does not need any calibration or logistic operation before the flight. By means of the control of a selected set of signals generated by the OBIGGS, the crew is permanently aware of the status of the equipment.",Fuel tanks and systems,25172400,Transportation components and systems,25170000,Commercial and Military and Private Vehicles and their Accessories and Components,25000000

 The hollow fiber separation process
 Based on a hollow fiber separation process, the OBIGGS allows to produce during the mission the flow of Nitrogen Enriched Air (NEA) requested to protect the aircraft. Part of the oxygen contained in the fuel tank is replaced by Nitrogen, keeping the vapours non-flammable.
 The OBIGGS includes a filtration chain, a pressure & temperature controller, an oxygen sensor and air separation modules. Depending on the applications, it can integrate a Temperature Management System to condition the bleed air. Compressed air is directly tapped an aircraft air circuit and transformed into NEA that is directly distributed in the fuel tanks.
 15-years experience in fuel tanks explosion reduction enables Air Liquide to support the customer also for the design the distribution system: Inerting modelling, piping sizing, NEA injection location, supply of distribution components. The use of the OBIGGS does not need any calibration or logistic operation before the flight. By means of the control of a selected set of signals generated by the OBIGGS, the crew is permanently aware of the status of the equipment.",Filters,40161500,Industrial filtering and purification,40160000,Distribution and Conditioning Systems and Equipment and Components,40000000

 How does it work?
 This autonomous generation system uses a gas separation technology with a semi permeable membrane. A membrane is a set of small diameter hollow polymer fibers. These fibers were selected to be more permeable to oxygen and oxygenated compounds (H2O, CO2) than to nitrogen. Pressurized inlet gas is continuously separated as it passes through the fiber. Then, it is pressurized and filtered in order to reach the aeronautical quality (STANAG 3624), 99.5%. The generator is equipped with a programmable logic controller that manages the start-up and production process.

 Increased reliability and useful life ǀ This equipment has a completely passive cold finger and the compressor pistons are held on flexible bearings that eliminate all contact with the casings
 Reduced cost ǀ The simplicity of the cold finger, the lack of moving parts, and the lack of hydraulic actuators, reduce the complexity of the cooler drive electronics, thereby reducing the system impact and therefore costs.
 Vibration levels that are compatible with space applications ǀ The remarkably low levels of vibration (a few mN) mean that these machines are compatible with the very stringent specifications for photo detectors.
 Compliant with the highest standards ǀ ECSS ESA space standards

 For this type of application, the technological simplicity and sturdiness of miniature coolers based on a compressed gas unit are evidence of reliability and ease of integration.
 The range comprises coolers that differ according to refrigerant capacity, cool-down time and autonomy specific to the application. These levels of performance are obtained as a function of the type of gas used, pure gas like nitrogen or argon, or gas mixture, and the inlet pressure of this gas.
 These coolers comprise:
 A heat exchanger in which the high pressure gas is pre-cooled in counterflow by the expanded low pressure cold gas
 An expansion outlet of fixed cross-section (single flow devices), or dual cross-section (dual flow devices), or variable cross-section (metered devices)
 A valve with actuator and obturator to vary the cross-section of the expansion outlet (dual flow and metered devices)
 Differential contraction valve for rapid cool-down of a significant thermal mass

Située à Truccazzano, près de Milan, l'unité contribue à la décarbonation du secteur des transports en valorisant les déchets agricoles et d'élevage des exploitations locales pour produire du biométhane liquéfié. Deux autres unités de production sont en cours de construction dans la région.
 Air Liquide exploite le digesteur qui reçoit les matières premières des fermes voisines pour produire du biogaz, ce qui garantit une faible empreinte carbone par rapport au gaz fossile extrait. Grâce aux technologies propriétaires d'Air Liquide, ce biogaz est purifié en biométhane, puis liquéfié pour être utilisé comme carburant. La capacité de production de l'unité lui permettra d'alimenter plus de 40 camions par jour. Ce carburant propre non fossile permet de réduire les émissions de particules fines jusqu'à 85 %, les émissions de CO2 de 90 % et la pollution sonore jusqu'à 50 % par rapport au diesel.
 De plus, l'unité est équipée d'une technologie spécifique qui permet de purifier le digestat, un sous-produit de la production de biométhane, qui peut ensuite être utilisé comme engrais par les agriculteurs.
 Air Liquide a commencé la construction de deux autres unités de production de biométhane, à Fontanella et à Covo, toutes deux situées près de Milan, dans la province de Bergame. Ces deux unités de production supplémentaires devraient être opérationnelles d'ici la fin 2022.
 Air Liquide a développé des compétences tout au long de la chaîne de valeur du biométhane, depuis la production de biogaz à partir de déchets jusqu'à sa purification en biométhane, sa liquéfaction, son stockage et son transport jusqu'à la distribution. Au niveau mondial, y compris l'unité de Truccazzano, Air Liquide compte désormais 22 unités de production de biométhane opérationnelles pour une capacité de production annuelle de 1,6 TWh.
 Gianluca Cremonesi , Directeur Général d'Air Liquide Biogas Solutions Italie, a déclaré : ""Avec cette première unité de production de biométhane, qui sera bientôt suivie de deux autres unités, Air Liquide contribue à la décarbonation du secteur des transports en Italie et au développement d'une économie circulaire locale. Ces investissements illustrent la capacité du Groupe à fournir à ses clients des solutions bas carbone, en ligne avec sa stratégie de Développement Durable.""",Petroleum and distillates,15101500,Fuels,15100000,Fuels and Fuel Additives and Lubricants and Anti corrosive Materials,15000000

EUV drives Moore’s Law forward and supports novel transistor designs and chip architectures.
 Mass producing leading-edge microchips
 If you have a relatively new smartphone, one of the latest gaming consoles or a smart watch, it’s likely you’ve benefited directly from EUV lithography technology.
 Leading-edge microchips contain billions of transistors. With each new generation (often referred to as a ‘node’), chipmakers pack in ever more and tinier transistors to make the chips more powerful, faster and energy efficient.
 Using a wavelength of 13.5 nm, our EUV systems pattern the finest lines on microchips. They are used in high-volume manufacturing to create the highly complex foundation layers of the most advanced microchips (7 nm, 5 nm and 3 nm nodes).
 Driving affordable scaling
 Using EUV makes scaling more affordable for chipmakers and allows the semiconductor industry to continue its pursuit of Moore’s Law. EUV systems are used to print the most intricate layers on a chip, with the rest of the layers printed using various DUV systems. Both types of technology will be required in parallel for many years to come and we’re continuing to advance both technologies.
 EUV lithography system portfolio
 TWINSCAN NXE: 3600D
 The TWINSCAN NXE:3600D is currently ASML’s most advanced lithography system, supporting volume production at the 5 and 3 nm Logic nodes and leading-edge DRAM nodes.
 TWINSCAN NXE: 3400C
 The TWINSCAN NXE:3400C lithography system supports volume production at the 7 and 5 nm nodes.
 The road to EUV
 EUV technology took more than two decades to develop
 Engineering EUV was anything but simple. ASML invested more than 6 billion in EUV R&D over 17 years. We acquired Cymer – a company specialized in light source technology – to accelerate EUV source development. And once the technology was developed, we had to overcome numerous technical challenges to meet chipmaker’s requirements for high-volume manufacturing.
 How EUV lithography was developed
 Researchers and scientists first began to explore EUV lithography in the 1980s, with the first successful applications of this new technology occurring toward the end of the decade.
 Work to industrialize the technology kicked off in 1994, with a coalition of semiconductor industry companies (including ASML) delivering the very first prototype. This prototype proved that EUV lithography was possible, and the industry started to pursue the technology.
 But EUV was a challenging and costly pursuit and, in time, only ASML – with our partners and suppliers – continued work toward a viable system. In August 2006 we shipped the world’s first EUV lithography demo tool to the College of Nanoscale Science & Engineering in Albany, in the US, and to imec in Leuven, Belgium. The college and company used these prototypes to learn about EUV and how it might fit into the semiconductor manufacturing process.
 In spite of the global financial crisis in 2008, we continued to invest in EUV. In the Spring of 2008, the College of Nanoscale Science & Engineering used their demo tool to produce the world’s first full-field EUV test chips . And in 2009, we opened the buildings that would house cleanrooms and workspaces for EUV development and production at our Veldhoven headquarters in the Netherlands.
 Then, in 2010, the first TWINSCAN NXE:3100, a pre-production EUV system, was shipped to one of our major customers. Two years later, six more systems were shipped to different customers. The first EUV production system – the TWINSCAN NXE:3300 – was shipped in 2013, signaling another step forward in the development of this new technology.
 Though there were delays and difficulties, EUV lithography turned a corner in 2016. Customers began ordering the NXE:3400 in higher numbers. At the beginning of 2020, we celebrated the 100th EUV system shipment.
 What’s next after EUV NXE? Reaching High-NA
 To enable further innovation in chip manufacturing, we’re developing a next-generation EUV platform that increases the numerical aperture (NA) from 0.33 to 0.55 (‘High-NA’).
 The High-NA platform, called ‘EXE’, has a novel optics design and significantly faster wafer and reticle stages. It will enable geometric chip scaling well into the next decade. The EXE platform has been designed to enable multiple future nodes, starting at the 2 nm Logic node and followed by Memory nodes at similar density.
 Development of this next-generation platform is ramping up, with first shipments of High-NA systems to customers for R&D purposes expected to take place at the end of 2023. EXE high-volume manufacturing systems are expected to be fully operational in customer factories by 2025.
 Frequently asked questions about EUV lithography
 What does EUV stand for?
 EUV stands for ‘extreme ultraviolet’. It refers to the light’s wavelength. The deep ultraviolet (DUV) light used in chip production has wavelengths of 248 and 193 nm, whereas the light used in EUV lithography has a wavelength of 13.5 nm.
 Read more about light in lithography
 How does EUV light in lithography work?
 To generate extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light, a CO2 laser fires two separate laser pulses at a fast-moving drop of tin. This vaporizes the tin and creates EUV light. It does this up to 50,000 times per second. Several multilayer mirrors to guide the EUV light to the wafer, shrinking the reticle pattern by a factor of four. The wafer stage positions the wafer under the light to within a quarter of a nanometer for each exposure, checking and adjusting 20,000 times per second.
 Find out more about lights and lasers.
 What is EUV lithography used for?
 EUV lithography is used to pattern the finest details on the most advanced microchips. Because EUV lithography can pack more transistors onto a single chip, these chips can be mass produced affordably. They also have more processing brainpower, use less energy and have higher performance. In turn, this is enabling smart cars, phones and homes, augmented reality and voice recognition solutions, and much more.
 Discover the basics of microchips.
 What companies manufacture EUV lithography systems?
 EUV lithography is currently a technology entirely unique to ASML. Other companies also produce lithography systems, but ASML’s cutting edge EUV platform is leading the semiconductor game and enabling cutting-edge technology.

 During lithography, diffraction of the light as well as physical and chemical effects in the photosensitive layer deform the image the machine is trying to print (think of this as trying to draw a thin fine line with a broad watercolor paint brush - it smudges in many places).
 With the introduction of 130 nm technology, addressing these deformations became essential to prevent defects. As chipmakers continued to shrink the patterns to make small and more powerful chips, the problems and complexity escalated, requiring ever-more sophisticated approaches.
 Model manufacturing
 Computational lithography uses algorithmic models of the manufacturing process, calibrated with key data from our machines and from test wafers. These models are used to optimize the mask, or blueprint of the desired end result, by intentionally deforming the patterns to compensate for the physical and chemical effects that occur during lithography and patterning. The net result: we end up with an accurate replica of the desired chip patterns on the wafer.",Computers,43211500,Computer Equipment and Accessories,43210000,Information Technology Broadcasting and Telecommunications,43000000

 Semiconductor Silicone Materials – Essential to Semiconductor Fabrication
 When it comes to materials used to manufacture semiconductors, most people are familiar with copper, but there are a number of silicone materials that are essential to key processes such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD)/atomic layer deposition (ALD) gas/precursor, and spin-on dielectrics (SOD).
 As the semiconductor industry broadens its adoption of copper interconnects, the needs increase for a copper-diffusion barrier with a low dielectric constant – that is, a small dielectric constant relative to silicon dioxide (SiO2) and silicon nitride (SiN).
 Low-k material implementation is one of several strategies used to allow continued scaling of microelectronic devices to remain on the path of Moore’s Law.
 Moreover, as pattern resolution becomes narrower, chipmakers’ need increases for thinner films made of silicon oxide (SiO) or silicon nitride through the ALD process. Both types of thin films require a precursor processing step that uses specialty silicon materials.
 This is an area where DuPont excels.
 We have the industry’s largest market share for semiconductor silicone materials, and we have had products in the space for more than 20 years. These include trimethylsilane (3MS), tetramethylsilane (4MS), flowable oxide (FOx) and hexachlorodisilane (HCDS).
 Our secure, high-quality supply of silicon-based CVD precursor materials for the global semiconductor manufacturing industry includes SiO2, silicon carbide (SiC), silicon oxycarbide (SiCO) and SiNx films.
 Our spin-on dielectrics are used widely as inter-level dielectrics in multilevel metal integrated circuit (IC) designs.
 If you demand high-quality, customer-endorsed semiconductor silicone material solutions with a proven history and stable supply to ensure your future requirements will be met, call on DuPont. We are ready to help.

 Not intended for full coverage – see Froth-Pak Insulation
 The self-contained portable kits contain everything you need, with no additional gas cylinder or electricity required.
 Avoid exposing cured foam to temperatures above 240F.
 Tubing inside the tank can become damaged if shaken too hard.
 If applied outdoors, be sure to paint or cover foam to prevent discoloration and UV damage.
 Always refer to the installation guide for safe usage and local building codes prior to application.
 The temperature indicator – not available on Froth-Pak 620 kits – on the side of the tank shows the temperature of the contents of the tank, not ambient air temperature.
 For best results, the tank contents should be at 75F (24C) or warmer. Ambient and surface temperatures should be 65F or above.
 Froth-Pak Foam can be applied effectively in cooler air temperatures or on cooler work surfaces provided the kit contents are at least 75F (24C). (See user manual, Section 4.3 - Cold weather spray guidance)
 If hoses are not already attached, use the wrench provided in the Gun / Hose Assembly Kit or your own 5/8” wrench to tighten the hose assemblies for both “A” and “B” valves until both are tight.
 Apply petroleum jelly to inside surfaces of the face of the gun.
 Do not attempt to reuse nozzle if spray has stopped for more than 30 seconds (or more than 15 seconds for the FROTH-PAK High-Density product). Restart times are impacted by temperature. (See section 3.2 in user manual)
 Do not reuse a cured or partially cured nozzle. This may cause foam to crossover in the gun, rendering it unusable.
 If A:B ratio appears wrong, check face of the gun to ensure the ports are clear of cured material (you should be able to see the silver finish of the aluminum spool in the ports). Purge foam through gun for a few seconds without a nozzle. Replace nozzle and try again.
 To prevent foam from running or dripping from substrate, spray thinner passes. The foam expands more than the previous formulation, so spray faster passes. Initial spray does not need to be as thick to result in the same desired final thickness.
 Apply a flash-coat for optimal adhesion in suboptimal conditions (cool weather, difficult substrates). A fan nozzle is best used for this. Spray a very thin layer (1/4” thick) on entire surface to be foamed. Allow the foam to become tack free (1 minute). Then spray as usual to desired thickness.",Aluminum coil,30265100,Structural materials,30260000,Structures and Building and Construction and Manufacturing Components and Supplies,30000000

 Product FAQ
 Q. Where can I use Great Stuff Pro Gaps & Cracks?
 A.
 Great Stuff Pro Gaps & Cracks can be used in a variety of interior and exterior applications, most commonly in air sealing and home retrofit applications, including:
 Electrical wire penetrations
 Gas line penetrations
 Plumping and pipe penetrations
 Q. What is the difference between Great Stuff and Great Stuff Pro products?
 A.
 There are two key differences between Great Stuff and Great Stuff Pro products:
 Great Stuff uses a straw dispenser; Great Stuff Pro has both straw- and gun-applicator options to dispense foam.
 Can sizes are larger with Great Stuff Pro series, so yield is greater.
 Q. How do I get Great Stuff foam off of my skin?
 A. If the foam has not cured or hardened, use fingernail polish remover (with acetone); a polyglycol-based skin cleanser or corn oil may be effective. Then wash with soap and plenty of water. If the foam has hardened, there is no solvent that will remove it. It will not harm your skin and will wear off over time. To remove cured foam from skin, use a pumice stone (available at most drug stores) and warm, soapy water. Then apply petroleum jelly.
 Q. Can I clean the Great Stuff Black gun?
 A.
 Yes!
 Unscrew used Great Stuff Pro from dispensing gun.
 Clean the gun basket and tip by generously spraying and removing uncured foam with Great Stuff Foam Cleaner.
 Invert the can and install the cleaner onto the dispensing gun.

 What are CMP Slurries?
 The chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) process is used to planarize both die level and wafer level topography and also to remove overfill metal and metalloid materials that serve as interconnects in an integrated circuit. CMP pads and slurries are used together in combination on a polishing tool multiple times throughout the semiconductor fabrication process.
 Slurries are made up of a combination of key additives which enable precise polishing of the wafer surface. Slurries are designed to enable the planarization and material removal such that surface quality and material property integrity is maintained or improved. State-of-the-art polishing slurries enable topography or flatness to be maintained at or less than 300 angstroms across a 300mm wafer. Surface finish of materials, including corrosion sensitive metals, is maintained at the single-digit angstrom level.

Great Stuff Pro series is available in larger cans (20,24, & 30 oz sizes) and use the dispensing guns to apply.
 Q. Can Great Stuff products be used outdoors?
 A.
 Yes.
 Great Stuff and Great Stuff Pro products can be used outdoors. However, cured foam will discolor if exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light. If left exposed, the foam will eventually crumble. Paint or coat foam for best results in outdoor applications.
 Great Stuff Pro Gasket is not approved for used outdoors
 Q. How do I get Great Stuff foam off of my skin?
 A. If the foam has not cured or hardened, use fingernail polish remover (with acetone); a polyglycol-based skin cleanser or corn oil may be effective. Then wash with soap and plenty of water. If the foam has hardened, there is no solvent that will remove it. It will not harm your skin and will wear off over time. To remove cured foam from skin, use a pumice stone (available at most drug stores) and warm, soapy water. Then apply petroleum jelly.

 Electronic connectors join circuit elements together. They come in a wide range of shapes and sizes, from standard formats such as USB to custom products designed for a specific application. Demands on connectors depend on the dimensions and the end-use cases. Connectors may be single insertion—connected once during product assembly and remaining in place for the lifetime of the product—or multi-insertion, where they must maintain electrical conductivity during many insertions.
 Making Reliable Connections
 Automotive applications are driving the greatest need for new connector designs and materials. Connectors must operate in harsh environments, exposed to high temperature and corrosive chemicals. The automotive industry requires both single insertion and multi-insertion connectors and is migrating toward solderless press-fit connections.
 Surface finishes play a critical role in connector reliability.

 Product FAQ
 Q. Can I clean the Great Stuff Blue gun?
 A.
 The water-based product can be cleaned from the Blue handled gun with the cleanout adapter provided in the Great Stuff Pro Dispensing Gun packaging. Remove the empty can, dispense residue from the gun, screw the adapter into the gun's basket, screw this assembly onto a garden hose or similar source of water.
 Flush 4-8 oz of water through the gun until it runs clear.
 The gun can be left wet, or excess water blown out with 10-20psi compressed air if available.
 Dispose of the rinse water as you would the washings of a latex paint brush. Do not dump into sewer, on ground or in a body of water.
 Q. How can I store Great Stuff Pro Gasket if I don't use the entire can?
 A. The can may be left attached to the Blue Great Stuff Pro Dispensing Gun for up to 90 days. Close the adjustment dial and store up-right where the can will not be punctured. To restart, shake vigorously for 60 seconds, dispense a small amount of foam into a trash can until normal bead expansion is observed. Proceed with normal application
 Q. The Great Stuff Pro Gasket Gun looks similar to Great Stuff Pro polyurethane foam guns. Can I use one of those?
 A.
 No. Great Stuff Pro Gasket is water-based, whereas one-component polyurethane reacts with water to cure. Mixing the two would permanently clog the gun.
 The Great Stuff Pro Gasket Dispensing Gun has a Blue Handle which matches the Blue Collars on its can. This is a visual check to only use Blue Guns with Blue Collars , and Black Guns with Black Collars .
 Q. Is Great Stuff Pro Gasket available in straw cans?
 A. No, Great Stuff Pro Gasket is only dispensed with the special gun identifiable by its blue handle.
 Helpful Tips
 Best results if used when product temperature ranges from 60-90F. Do not allow it to freeze.
 If the can sputters, simply shake it some more with the can upside down.
 Great Stuff Pro Gasket can be cleaned with just water. Do NOT use Great Stuff Foam Cleaner with Great Stuff Pro Gasket or the Drywall Dispensing Gun. Instead, use the included hose adapter to flush water through the gun into an appropriate waste receptacle.
 Let cure before the drywall is installed. It is recommended to let Great Stuff Pro Gasket sit overnight as it can take up to 20 hours for full cure in high humidity situations.
 Do not use any other Great Stuff Pro products in the Drywall Gasket gun.
 Use a 1/2"" wide bead for best results.
 The bead will shrink and wrinkle in high humidity. However, as long as the bead maintains at least a 1/8” height, it will perform as designed, depending on the framing.
 If humidity exceeds 70%, we recommend a target bead of 5/8”-3/4”. Do not exceed a 3/4” initial bead to prevent sagging.

Great Stuff Pro series is available in larger cans (20,24, & 30 oz sizes) and use the dispensing guns to apply.
 Q. Can Great Stuff products be used outdoors?
 A.
 Yes.
 Great Stuff and Great Stuff Pro products can be used outdoors. However, cured foam will discolor if exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light. If left exposed, the foam will eventually crumble. Paint or coat foam for best results in outdoor applications.
 Great Stuff Pro Gasket is not approved for used outdoors
 Q. How do I get Great Stuff foam off of my skin?
 A. If the foam has not cured or hardened, use fingernail polish remover (with acetone); a polyglycol-based skin cleanser or corn oil may be effective. Then wash with soap and plenty of water. If the foam has hardened, there is no solvent that will remove it. It will not harm your skin and will wear off over time. To remove cured foam from skin, use a pumice stone (available at most drug stores) and warm, soapy water. Then apply petroleum jelly.

 Product FAQ
 Q. What is Great Stuff Pro Gasket?
 A. Great Stuff Pro Gasket is a flexible, water-based, one-component foam designed to form an interior gasket between framing lumber and drywall, which improves air sealing performance. Material is applied and allowed to dry to the face of the top plate, bottom plate and around the perimeter of all rough openings before installing drywall. The unique gasket performance allows product use without any changes to construction sequencing.
 Q. Where is the preferred application location?
 A.
 Any location where drywall will be installed tight against framing lumber is particularly suitable for Great Stuff Pro Gasket. In particular, the face of top plates, bottom plates and the framing around rough window and door openings, as well as inside and outside framing corners.
 .
 Q. Can I continue to use my current drywall installation methods?
 A.
 Yes.
 Once dried, Great Stuff Pro Gasket is designed to tolerate standard drywall installation techniques, including when boards are placed against the wall studs and slid up to meet the ceiling drywall. While this motion may deform the round gasket bead profile to a ""shark fin"", it will remain in place on the top plate and keep its thickness to seal the gap between the top plate and back side of the drywall.
 Q. Can I clean the Great Stuff Blue gun?
 A.
 The water-based product can be cleaned from the Blue handled gun with the cleanout adapter provided in the Great Stuff Pro Dispensing Gun packaging. Remove the empty can, dispense residue from the gun, screw the adapter into the gun's basket, screw this assembly onto a garden hose or similar source of water.
 Flush 4-8 oz of water through the gun until it runs clear.
 The gun can be left wet, or excess water blown out with 10-20psi compressed air if available.
 Dispose of the rinse water as you would the washings of a latex paint brush. Do not dump into sewer, on ground or in a body of water.
 Q. How can I store Great Stuff Pro Gasket if I don't use the entire can?
 A. The can may be left attached to the Blue Great Stuff Pro Dispensing Gun for up to 90 days. Close the adjustment dial and store up-right where the can will not be punctured. To restart, shake vigorously for 60 seconds, dispense a small amount of foam into a trash can until normal bead expansion is observed. Proceed with normal application
 Q. Is Great Stuff Pro Gasket an insulation?
 A. No. This product is an air sealant and functions best when compressed as a gasket.
 Helpful Tips
 Best results if used when product temperature ranges from 60-90F. Do not allow it to freeze.
 If the can sputters, simply shake it some more with the can upside down.
 Great Stuff Pro Gasket can be cleaned with just water. Do NOT use Great Stuff Foam Cleaner with Great Stuff Pro Gasket or the Drywall Dispensing Gun. Instead, use the included hose adapter to flush water through the gun into an appropriate waste receptacle.
 Let cure before the drywall is installed. It is recommended to let Great Stuff Pro Gasket sit overnight as it can take up to 20 hours for full cure in high humidity situations.
 Do not use any other Great Stuff Pro products in the Drywall Gasket gun.
 Use a 1/2"" wide bead for best results.
 The bead will shrink and wrinkle in high humidity. However, as long as the bead maintains at least a 1/8” height, it will perform as designed, depending on the framing.
 If humidity exceeds 70%, we recommend a target bead of 5/8”-3/4”. Do not exceed a 3/4” initial bead to prevent sagging.

 Enabling High Resolution Microlithography for Advanced Integrated Circuit (IC) Manufacturing
 DuPont’s organic bottom anti-reflectant coatings (BARCs) are cross-linkable polymers that are spin cast on wafers and serve the purpose of controlling the back-reflection of light from the wafer surface into the resist material above it. DuPont’s AR Fast Etch Organic BARCs are based on polymers that contain a chromophore to reduce substrate reflectivity and include oxygen-rich monomers that etch quickly during the pattern transfer step. The fast etch properties of these products and the easy removal without significant loss of the resist film thickness are key to making advanced integrated circuits.
 Advantages of DuPont's AR Fast Etch Organic BARCs
 Substantially faster etch rates than the organic photoresist
 AR Fast Etch Organic BARCs etch 30% faster than photoresists, compared to conventional BARCs that have the same etch rate as photoresists.
 Significantly faster etch rates than vacuum deposited inorganic films
 DuPont’s fast etch technology minimizes resist consumption, reduces line edge roughness variations and reduces critical dimension (CD) changes after pattern transfer.
 Easily removed without significant loss of the resist film thickness
 AR Fast Etch Organic BARCs etch quickly during the pattern transfer step preserving (thinner) resist thickness which is necessary for better resolution.
 Maintaining the pattern fidelity and preserving the resist pattern thickness of integrated circuits is essential for good electrical performance in high yield and for high volume manufacturing.
 Figure 1. Dow AR Fast Etch Organic BARCs solve the issues of light reflection that impact negatively on photoresist resolution. Use of Fast Etch Organic BARC diminishes reflectance from the substrate.
 Figure 2. The image on the left is an example of improved line width control when using Dow’s AR Fast Etch Organic BARCs. The image on the right shows a pinched line, a common defect when no organic BARC is use

 Product FAQ
 Q. Is there a cutter attached?
 A.
 There is no cutter attached, we recommend using a utility knife to get the perfect cut.
 Q. What is the rod on the barrel of the dispenser?
 A.
 The rod on the side of the caulk dispenser is used to pierce the seal of your tube, allowing caulk to begin flowing through the nozzle.
 Q. What is a thrust ratio?
 A.
 Thrust ratio relates to the amount of force generated each time you squeeze the hand trigger. The higher the ratio, the more force exerted with each squeeze. As an example; a 12:1 thrust ratio means you squeeze the trigger 24 times before reaching the end, where a 7:1 ratio means you will only squeeze 14 times to cover the same distance. We recommend using higher thrust ratios on higher viscosity caulks/sealants.
 Q.
 How do I get the longest life out of my caulk dispenser?
 A.
 We recommend that you regularly wash and lubricate the dispenser after use, especially in the location of the thrust mechanism.

 Preparation of the base plastic for optimal coverage and adhesion provides the basis for subsequent performance of the plated article
 DuPont’s expertise in high performance colloidal catalysts and stable electroless copper and nickel provide high yielding pre-treatment of ABS and ABS-PC blends. Other polymers, such as PA are also plateable using the unique Addiposit plating process.
 Meanwhile, in response to the regulatory changes affecting the plating on plastic (POP) industry, DuPont has developed Ecoposit CF-800 chromium-free etch (CFE) and Ecoposit XF-1000 Formaldehyde Free Electroless Copper . Our customers who plate Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) as part of their POP manufacturing work flow now have a way to eliminate the use of hexavalent chromium to comply to Reach.
 Electroplate (Copper, Nickel, Chromium)
 Electrodeposited copper provides the strength and levelling of the substrate onto which nickel and chrome provide the subsequent corrosion protection and decorative finish
 Ecoposit 95HT Low Stress, High Throw Copper
 What is Plating on Plastics?
 Injection-molded parts are processed through the “POP” process using etching for adhesion promotion, followed by catalytic deposition of nickel or copper to make the part conductive. The part is then finished with electrolytic copper, nickel, and chromium to provide the desired strength, appearance, and corrosion performance.
 Combining Decorative and Functional
 Applications as varied as automobiles, home appliances, sanitary ware, and beauty products rely on chromium finishes to create an attractive, durable, and corrosion-resistant finish on plastic parts. The requirements of the end application for the part will determine the optimum base materials, metal type, and plating thickness, which in turn defines the process and performance.",Thermoplastic plastics,13102000,Rubber and elastomers,13100000,Resin and Rosin and Rubber and Foam and Film and Elastomeric Materials,13000000

 Froth-Pak Spray Foam Insulation comes in a variety of sizes to suit your needs.
 The self-contained portable kits contain everything you need, with no additional gas cylinder or electricity required.
 Avoid exposing cured foam to temperatures above 240F.
 Tubing inside the tank can become damaged if shaken too hard.
 If applied outdoors, be sure to paint or cover foam to prevent discoloration and UV damage.
 Always refer to the installation guide for safe usage and local building codes prior to application.
 For best results, the tank contents should be at 75F (24C) or warmer. Ambient and surface temperatures should be 65F or above.
 The temperature indicator – not available on Froth-Pak 650 kits – on the side of the tank shows the temperature of the contents of the tank, not the ambient air temperature.
 Froth-Pak Foam can be applied effectively in cooler air temperatures or on cooler work surfaces provided the kit contents are at least 75F (24C). (See user manual, Section 4.3 - Cold weather spray guidance)
 If hoses are not already attached, use the wrench provided in the Gun / Hose Assembly Kit or your own 5/8” wrench to tighten the hose assemblies for both “A” and “B” valves until both are tight.
 Apply petroleum jelly to the inside surfaces of the face of the gun
 .Do not attempt to reuse the nozzle if the spray has stopped for more than 30 seconds (or more than 15 seconds for the FROTH-PAK High-Density product). Restart times are impacted by temperature. (See section 3.2 in user manual)
 Do not reuse a cured or partially cured nozzle. This may cause foam to crossover in the gun, rendering it unusable.
 If A:B ratio appears wrong, check face of the gun to ensure the ports are clear of cured material (you should be able to see the silver finish of the aluminum spool in the ports). Purge foam through gun for a few seconds without a nozzle. Replace nozzle and try again.
 To prevent foam from running or dripping from substrate, spray thinner passes. The foam expands more than the previous formulation, so spray faster passes. Initial spray does not need to be as thick to result in the same desired final thickness.
 Apply a flash-coat for optimal adhesion in suboptimal conditions (cool weather, difficult substrates). A fan nozzle is best used for this. Spray a very thin layer (1/4” thick) on entire surface to be foamed. Allow the foam to become tack free (1 minute). Then spray as usual to desired thickness.",Thermal insulation,30141500,Insulation,30140000,Structures and Building and Construction and Manufacturing Components and Supplies,30000000

 Supporting Today’s Critical Dimensions in Lithography
 DuPont’s state-of-the-art advanced overcoat products decrease the occurrence of defects before or after wafer patterning. Our unique formulations provide you with new solutions for today’s patterning challenges, enabling you to reach critical dimensions that can’t be achieved through conventional lithography processes alone. Scaling to advanced nodes without extreme ultra violet (EUV) lithography is now possible.
 DuPont’s advanced overcoat product lines for lithography include:
 Topcoats: Designed for positive tone photoresists, our positive tone development topcoats increase hydrophobicity of the photoresist surface, decreasing defects.
 NTO Overcoats: Intended for yield enhancement, our negative tone, spin-on formulations create a uniform surface across multiple resists with different surface properties. These materials allow for multiple scanner adjustments to be made as if it were a single resist. NTO Overcoats feature high hydrophobicity and achieve a high contact angle.
 CTO Overcoats: These spin-on alternatives to plasma-etch processes are a low-cost way to trim critical dimensions by reducing bridging defects that form at the top of the resist. CTO Overcoats reduce scum in darkfield features and can be used to clean difficult-to-remove resist from isolated trenches.
 Product families:
 NTO 5000 Overcoat
 CTO 1150 Overcoat
 CTO 125 Overcoat
 What are Advanced Overcoats?
 Advanced overcoats are materials intended for use in conjunction with photoresists, either before or after the photolithography step. They are designed to prevent defects and improve the lithography process window.
 Alternatives to Advanced Lithography
 Coating an NTO Overcoat on top of photoresist before patterning creates a hydrophobic surface that prevents water droplets from forming during immersion lithography processes
 As an alternative to EUV lithography, CTO Overcoat can be applied after ArF lithography to reduce the amount of remaining photoresist and shrink the patterning lines",Nominant organic vegetables,50417000,Organic fresh vegetables,50410000,Food Beverage and Tobacco Products,50000000

 Product FAQ
 Q. Is there a cutter attached?
 A.
 There is no cutter attached, we recommend using a utility knife to get the perfect cut.
 Q. What is the rod on the barrel of the dispenser?
 A.
 The rod on the side of the caulk dispenser is used to pierce the seal of your tube, allowing caulk to begin flowing through the nozzle.
 Q. What is a thrust ratio?
 A.
 Thrust ratio relates to the amount of force generated each time you squeeze the hand trigger. The higher the ratio, the more force exerted with each squeeze. As an example; a 12:1 thrust ratio means you squeeze the trigger 24 times before reaching the end, where a 7:1 ratio means you will only squeeze 14 times to cover the same distance. We recommend using higher thrust ratios on higher viscosity caulks/sealants.
 Q.
 How do I get the longest life out of my caulk dispenser?
 A.
 We recommend that you regularly wash and lubricate the dispenser after use, especially in the location of the thrust mechanism.

 Product FAQ
 Q. Where can I use Great Stuff Pro Pestblock?
 A.
 Great Stuff Pro Pestblock can be used in a variety of interior and exterior applications, most commonly in air sealing and home retrofit applications, including:
 Under baseboards and attic hatch frames
 Hose bibs
 Dryer vents
 PVC pipe penetrations
 Plumbing penetrations
 Q. What is the difference between Great Stuff and Great Stuff Pro products?
 A.
 There are two key differences between Great Stuff and Great Stuff Pro products:
 Great Stuff uses a straw dispenser; Great Stuff Pro has both straw- and gun-applicator options to dispense foam.
 Can sizes are larger with Great Stuff Pro series, so yield is greater.
 Q. How do I get Great Stuff foam off of my skin?
 A. If the foam has not cured or hardened, use fingernail polish remover (with acetone); a polyglycol-based skin cleanser or corn oil may be effective. Then wash with soap and plenty of water. If the foam has hardened, there is no solvent that will remove it. It will not harm your skin and will wear off over time. To remove cured foam from skin, use a pumice stone (available at most drug stores) and warm, soapy water. Then apply petroleum jelly.
 Q. Can I clean the Great Stuff Black gun?
 A.
 Yes!
 Unscrew used Great Stuff Pro from dispensing gun.
 Clean the gun basket and tip by generously spraying and removing uncured foam with Great Stuff Foam Cleaner.
 Invert the can and install the cleaner onto the dispensing gun.
 Press the trigger to flush the foam into waste receptable until only the cleaner is visible.
 Allow gun to sit for several minutes and repeat with a second flush.
 Remove the can from the dispensing gun and spray into waste receptacle without the can until the gun is completely empty.
 Q. Can mice, insects or other pests chew through Great Stuff foam?
 A. Rodents and small animals, if determined enough, can chew through many materials, including Great Stuff foam. We have specifically designed a variation of our Great Stuff foam to solve this issue, Great Stuff Pestblock and Great Stuff Pro Pestblock. They BLOCK insects and pests from entering the home by sealing gaps, cracks and holes where they commonly enter. Great Stuff Pestblock and Great Stuff Pro Pestblock expand to fill, seal and insulate gaps up to 1"" (25 mm), forming a long-lasting, airtight and water-resistant barrier.
 Helpful Tips
 Shake vigorously for a minimum of 60 seconds. If the can sputters, simply shake the can while held upside down.
 Any uncured product that gets on the skin can be removed with acetone.
 Best results if used when product temperature ranges from 60-90F (15-32C). The can should not be exposed to temperatures more than 120F. Cured foam should not be exposed to temperatures in excess of 240F.
 Firmly screw straw assembly onto valve and dispense SLOWLY.
 Mist with water to speed cure.
 Trim cured foam with serrated blade.
 If applied outdoors, be sure to paint or cover foam to prevent discoloration and UV damage.
 If using GREAT STUFF PRO with the Foam Dispensing Gun, follow these additional steps before application:
 With the can secured, set your desired bead size by adjusting the flow control knob on the back of the gun (bead can be adjusted from 1/8""-3""). Then, pull the trigger to fill the gun with foam, dispensing excess foam into an appropriate waste receptacle. Lastly, test the bead size before applying.
 Tighten the flow control screw until fully closed for storage. Use can within 30 days of initial use.
 Store upright with a foam dispensing gun attached.
 Fill gaps 50%
 Always leave a can of foam attached to the gun with the flow control screw closed.
 When ready to change cans, shake the new can of foam for a minimum of 60 seconds.
 NEVER leave a gun without a can of Great Stuff Pro attached unless the gun has been thoroughly cleaned with Great Stuff Foam Cleaner.

To maintain long-term precision and to extend component life by reducing friction, wear and heat generation, proper lubrication is required.
 When selecting a lubricant, it is important to consider viscosity and speed rating and to carefully match them to the speed of the spindle. If using a grease in these high-speed applications, the thickener type and cleanliness of the lubricant can minimize the noise generated by the spindle. While greases, pastes or oils typically are used in these applications, an anti-friction coating or dispersion could be suitable as well, depending on the operation.
 Another important consideration is lubricant compatibility with the spindle substrate.
 In automotive spindle applications, lubricants must offer minimum difference between static and dynamic friction transitions, as well as consistent performance over wide temperature ranges.
 In industrial machining applications, after processing is complete, rust and corrosion on bare metal surfaces can be prevented by applying a protective coating.",Electric direct current DC motors,26101200,Power sources,26100000,Power Generation and Distribution Machinery and Accessories,26000000

 Q. Can I use Great Stuff and Great Stuff Pro foam to air seal my electrical receptacles?
 A. Great Stuff and Great Stuff Pro foam can be used to air seal around and behind electrical boxes and insulated wires but should never be used inside a box where it may be exposed to bare copper wires
 Q. How do I get Great Stuff foam off of my skin?
 A. If the foam has not cured or hardened, use fingernail polish remover (with acetone); a polyglycol-based skin cleanser or corn oil may be effective. Then wash with soap and plenty of water. If the foam has hardened, there is no solvent that will remove it. It will not harm your skin and will wear off over time. To remove cured foam from skin, use a pumice stone (available at most drug stores) and warm, soapy water. Then apply petroleum jelly.

 Putting the “Flexible” in Flexible Displays
 DuPont has been producing polyimide (PI) film and liquid for more than 50 years, predominantly for the electronics market. Our films have been used in countless demanding applications over the years, and our liquid counterpart technology was originally developed to make high purity, very low-particle PI solutions for semiconductor applications.
 Today, we have expanded these capabilities to flexible display applications for both amber and colorless PI liquid. We are also developing hard coat materials, impact protecting elastomeric materials, and clear and amber PI films.
 As the mobile device market has shifted toward bigger screens with better portability, smartphones, wearables and other devices have incorporated such design innovations as full-screen displays with no borders or bezels. New materials are essential to accommodate these design requirements, and to ensure displays move to the next level of flexibility – true foldable and rollable devices.
 We’re ahead of the curve
 Polyimide is the most important material for flexible displays, and ours is the strongest on the market. These materials are used in a range of flexible display components, including cover windows, touch screen panels, LCD and OLED substrates. Our liquid PI and films have excellent optical, thermal and mechanical properties, and maintain high optical transmittance and low haze even after 1 million bending cycles.
 No matter where you are in the world, you can take advantage of DuPont’s regional resources to help you advance development of your flexible display products. We look forward to working with you!

 What is Cu RDL?
 Copper RDL is an interconnect technology used in both fan-in and fan-out wafer level processing. It allows high-density I/Os to be redistributed for connection to the circuit board by increasing the pitch.
 Additionally, the purity of the Cu formulation reduces manufacturing costs by eliminating the nickel barrier between the copper and solder elements required by other plating approaches to control topography and eliminate defects.
 Meeting Finer Line and Space Requirements
 Driven by mobile applications that require increased functionality at lower power, RDL requirements are tightening from 5 µm line/space to 2 µm line/space. This calls for plating chemistries that can achieve high reliability with low-within-die uniformity.
 The function of additives in RDL plating is similar to those in Cu pillar plating. DuPont’s INTERVIA 9000 plating chemistry can be used for both RDL and Cu pillar plating in one plating tool without changing the plating bath, making it an economical choice.

 Product FAQ
 Q. Is there a cutter attached?
 A.
 There is no cutter attached, we recommend using a utility knife to get the perfect cut.
 Q. What is the rod on the barrel of the dispenser?
 A.
 The rod on the side of the caulk dispenser is used to pierce the seal of your tube, allowing caulk to begin flowing through the nozzle.
 Q. What is a thrust ratio?
 A.
 Thrust ratio relates to the amount of force generated each time you squeeze the hand trigger. The higher the ratio, the more force exerted with each squeeze. As an example; a 12:1 thrust ratio means you squeeze the trigger 24 times before reaching the end, where a 7:1 ratio means you will only squeeze 14 times to cover the same distance. We recommend using higher thrust ratios on higher viscosity caulks/sealants.
 Q.
 How do I get the longest life out of my caulk dispenser?
 A.
 We recommend that you regularly wash and lubricate the dispenser after use, especially in the location of the thrust mechanism.

 Product FAQ
 Q. What is Great Stuff?
 A. Great Stuff is the brand name for a line of one-component insulating foam sealants that can help make your home more comfortable and energy efficient by sealing the gaps and cracks where air conditioned and heated air escape. Great Stuff Pro Polyurethane Foam Sealants can be used for both small and large air sealing and retrofit applications by DIY’s or professionals. Great Stuff comes in cans with a straw applicator or the new patented Smart Dispenser. Cans are in 12, 16, and 20 oz sizes. Great Stuff Pro series is available in larger cans (20,24, & 30 oz sizes) and use the dispensing guns to apply.
 Q. Can I clean the Great Stuff Black gun?
 A.
 Yes!
 Unscrew used Great Stuff Pro from dispensing gun.
 Clean the gun basket and tip by generously spraying and removing uncured foam with Great Stuff Foam Cleaner.
 Invert the can and install the cleaner onto the dispensing gun.
 Press the trigger to flush the foam into waste receptable until only the cleaner is visible.
 Allow gun to sit for several minutes and repeat with a second flush.
 Remove the can from the dispensing gun and spray into waste receptacle without the can until the gun is completely empty.
 Q. How do I get Great Stuff foam off of my skin?
 A. If the foam has not cured or hardened, use fingernail polish remover (with acetone); a polyglycol-based skin cleanser or corn oil may be effective. Then wash with soap and plenty of water. If the foam has hardened, there is no solvent that will remove it. It will not harm your skin and will wear off over time. To remove cured foam from skin, use a pumice stone (available at most drug stores) and warm, soapy water. Then apply petroleum jelly.
 Q. Where can I buy Great Stuff and Great Stuff Pro products?
 A.
 Depending on where you live, you can buy Great Stuff products from local retail and hardware stores near you. Visit the Where to Buy page to find a retailer near you.
 Q. How do I get Great Stuff foam off the side of my house?
 A. There is no solvent that will remove cured insulating foam. If the foam has not cured yet, use Great Stuff Pro Foam Cleaner or fingernail polish remover (with acetone) to quickly remove the uncured foam. Test a small area of the substrate first as the chemicals in the nail polish remover and gun cleaner may not be compatible with the substrate being cleaned. For cured foam, remove as much as possible with a dull scraper or a hacksaw blade and then try scrubbing the remaining film with a non-abrasive cleaner. If that does not work, gradually move up to more aggressive means including sanding, sandblasting and repainting.
 Helpful Tips
 Shake vigorously for a minimum of 60 seconds. If the can sputters, simply shake the can while held upside down.

A new generation of via fill, Microfill EVF15 Via Fill, has been developed to meet these requirements with a plated copper (Cu) surface thickness of 15 microns. This new electrolytic chemistry was designed to be a drop-in solution for existing vertical continuous plater (VCP) lines.
 The new generation EVF provides the following benefits:
 Complete fill at lower Cu thickness
 Reduced dimples and skip-rate, and,
 Improved surface appearance.
 Compared to a conventional via fill process, the EVF15 provides better dimple performance at a lower plated Cu thickness ( Image 1 ). At higher plating thicknesses, a bump may be an issue, with an excessive bump creating issues with dielectric thickness or in stacked via applications. The EVF15 performs well, exhibiting a much smaller bump as compared to a conventional process ( Image 2 ). Filling performance as a function of plating thickness and current density also show excellent performance ( Image 3 and Image 4 ). Looking at the knee and through-hole throwing power (TP) performance, we can see that EVF15 outperforms a conventional via fill process ( Image 5 ).

 DuPont Interra thin copper clad laminates are specifically designed for use as embedded capacitance materials in multilayer rigid printed circuit boards. They offer the best mechanical strength, reliability and capacitance stability on the market.
 By utilizing Interra laminates between the power and ground planes in a Power Distribution Network (PDN), designers can reduce the modal resonances and lower the inductance between the power and ground planes. This has the effect of reducing the impedance in the system and decreasing the number of required surface mount capacitors.
 All Interra thin copper clad laminates utilize low-profile electrodeposited (ED) copper laminated to thin polyimide based dielectric. This dielectric is engineered to have superior adhesion to copper than traditional glass-reinforced materials utilized in rigid boards. The polyimide dielectric is based on DuPont Kapton technology, but is specifically engineered to have low dielectric loss, high dielectric isolation and strength, and tight thickness tolerance.

The challenge is twofold: candidate reflective materials must help extract every possible lumen from the LED architecture, and they must withstand the increasing temperatures and lumen densities of today's high-brightness LED light sources.
 Many are turning to DuPont and our expanding portfolio of optically reflective silicone materials. The remarkable thermal- and photo-stability of our reflective silicones introduces new possibilities for enhancing efficiency and quality of LED lighting.
 LED packaging solutions
 Improving reflectivity begins at the source - the LED die package. However, because packaging materials are located so close to the heat of the LED die, high thermal- and photo-stability is nearly as critical as high reflectivity.
 Unlike conventional organic materials, our reflective silicones will not physically or optically degrade after prolonged exposure to high lumen density or temperatures reaching 200C. As a result, they can help ensure excellent lumen maintenance over the expected lifetime of an LED package.",Exterior lighting fixtures and accessories,39111600,Lighting Fixtures and Accessories,39110000,Electrical Systems and Lighting and Components and Accessories and Supplies,39000000

 In addition to the classic ANTARES that has been used across multiple technology nodes in semiconductor fabs worldwide, TEL offers the new ANTARES – Nano which features a smaller aerosol size for improved removal efficiency in the smallest nanoparticle size range, plus improved capability for cleaning sensitive patterns without damage. Semiconductor manufacturers have advanced their technology through recent generations by introduction of various new materials, a trend which will continue for the foreseeable future. In many cases the materials have sensitivities which limit the applicability of historical wet clean processes for removing contaminants. Metals are easily corroded, hydrophobic films are prone to watermarks, and some materials such as Ge can be attacked by aqueous chemistries. Furthermore, even traditional materials such as Si and SiO 2 frequently must be cleaned with near-zero material loss, due to tightened dimensional requirements. Therefore, this ANTARES -Nano presents cleaning methods that are safe for all materials and patterns are increasingly needed.

 Identify cell sub-populations with advantageous phenotypes for growth or survival
 Assess changes in cell culture heterogeneity over time or changing culture conditions
 Track clonal expansion in tumours or during differentiation or metastasis
 Link CRISPR-induced genetic knockouts with changes in expression profiles
 The ability to label and trace individual cells is a powerful experimental tool in many research areas including cell development, tumor evolution, stem cell differentiation, or carcinogenesis. Cellecta’s expressed barcode libraries, together with next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, enable tracking of clonal variations in large cell populations.
 Using Cellecta’s CloneTracker Barcode Libraries, it is possible to genomically label each cell with a uniquely identifiable short nucleotide sequence (i.e., a barcode). Since the barcodes genomically
 integrate, they are heritable so all progeny from each cell harbours the same unique sequence and clonal expansion for each founder cell can be monitored.
 The initial transduction of a lentiviral barcode library (Figure 1) into cultured cells, produces a founder or starter population in which each cell has a unique and heritable barcode label. NGS can then be used to sort out sub-populations of progeny cells derived from the original progenitors at any point during an experiment. The approach provides a convenient way to identify cell variations with unique characteristics or biology, and to understand how these groups of variant cells evolve in response to drug treatment, tumor metastasis, or other conditions.
 Figure 1
 With Cellecta’s new CloneTracker XP Barcode Libraries (Figure 2) the barcode is designed to express on an RNA transcript. As a result, it can be detected by RNA sequencing, as well as DNA sequencing. Researchers can identify which genes are actually activated or shut down in different groups of cells. They can identify genes that are important for drug resistance, metastasis, cell differentiation, or other processes.” The CloneTracker XP Expressed Barcode libraries are available with barcodes expressed in the 3′- or 5′-UTR of an RNA transcript, and with fluorescent or chemiluminescent reporters.

 Not just another cationic lipid, GenomONE-Neo is a totally unique alternative to common tranfection reagents.
 GenomONE-Neo utilizes the high membrane fusion potential of inactivated Sendai virus particle (Hemagglutinating virus of Japan envelope, HVJ-E) for efficient transfection of nucleic acids, proteins, and small molecules.
 The HVJ envelope, carrying the molecule to be transfected, is composed of a completely inactivated and purified HVJ (Sendai virus) while preserving the cell membrane-fusing capability of the envelope.
 GenomONE provides ready-to-use kits containing the HVJ envelope and auxiliary reagents (incorporation enhancer, incorporation reagent, introduction enhancer, buffer).
 Principle
 What is HVJ Envelope (HVJ-E)?
 HVJ Envelope is a purified product prepared through complete inactivation of Sendai virus (HVJ*). It is a vesicle in which only the cell membrane-fusing capability of the envelope protein of Sendai virus is retained.
 It is known that the HN protein in the tunica externa of the Sendai virus recognizes the receptor (possessing sialic acid at the terminal of sugar chain) on the cell membrane and adsorbs it, leading to the induction of membrane fusion mediated by F protein (component of envelope). The genomic RNA of the Sendai virus contained in HVJ-E has been inactivated completely and has neither infective nor proliferative potential in humans or animals. HVJ-E can be used safely in standard laboratories, without requiring special procedures or facilities.
 *HVJ：Hemagglutinating Virus of Japan.
 Conventional non-viral transfection tools, including cationic lipids, are incorporated into cells through endocytosis which results in degradation of the transferred DNA by lysosomes. On the other hand, HVJ Envelope VECTOR resists degradation by lysosomes, making it easy to transfer the specified DNA. Therefore, HVJ Envelope VECTOR yields highly efficient gene expression.
 Sialic acid receptors, which are needed to trigger binding with HN protein, exist in almost all animal cells. Thus, HVJ Envelope VECTOR is useful for a wide range of targets.
 Features and Advantages
 1. Wide usability
 GenomONE HVJ Envelope VECTOR KIT is a highly flexible tool for transfecting a wide variety of molecules (plasmid DNAs, siRNAs, oligonucleotides, proteins, antibodies etc.) into cultured cells (adherent and non-adherent) and tissue. GenomONE is useful for transfecting sensitive primary cells and is further distinguished by its ability to deliver contents into live animals. Many literature citations are available for each GenomONE-Neo application.
 2. Safety
 Unlike cationic lipids, GenomONE-Neo delivers the molecule of interest into cells via membrane fusion, not by endocytosis where cargo may be degraded by lysosomal enzymes. Since GenomeONE-Neo is a purified HVJ (Sendai virus) product, prepared from virus particles completely inactivated for infectious ability and proliferative potential it is completely safe to use without special precautions.
 3. Easy
 GenomONE provides ready-to-use kits containing the HVJ envelope and required auxiliary reagents (incorporation enhancer, incorporation reagent, introduction enhancer, and buffer). Suggested protocols for all major applications are included.
 GenomONE-Neo - unique, exciting transfection kit for cells, tissue, and live animals.
 Use GenomONE-Neo : for:
 siRNA - strong knockdowns with low pM amounts of siRNA. Chemical modification of siRNA not required; means high functional expression..
 DNA - small and large, linear or circular
 Oligonucleotides - DNA, RNA
 Proteins - enzymes and antibodies retain function and specificity

 Background:
 This product does not contain any reagents to perform transcription and translation experiments.
 It was designed to modify the reaction conditions for better formation of disulfide bonds when working with the WEPRO7240H Core Kit. Reaction conditions are modify by adding a human endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductase (Ero1α) and a Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) to the translation reaction while using a different buffer composition for bilayer formation.
 Do not use the WEPRO7240 and WEPRO7240G Core kits as this will reduce protein yields. The GST-tag is unsuited when working with buffers containing glutathione as this will lead to a loss of disulfide bonds.
 Confirm reaction conditions using the Disulfide Bond PLUS Expression Kit.
 Features:
 In combination with the WEPRO7240H Core Kit, this set allows to prepare proteins on different scales using the bilayer format

 Continuous Kinetic Assay Typical Standard Curve for Glutathione Reductase Activity Kit (Enzyme Activity Assay) StressXpress - SKT-204. Assay Type: Direct. Detection Method: Fluorometric Assay. Assay Range: 0.156 - 5 mU/ml. End-Point Assay Typical Standard Curve for Glutathione Reductase Activity Kit (Enzyme Activity Assay) StressXpress - SKT-204. Assay Type: Direct. Detection Method: Fluorometric Assay. Assay Range: 0.156 - 5 mU/ml. Chemical equation of the Glutathione Reductase reaction. The regeneration of GSH is catalyzed by Glutathione Reductase. Glutathione Reductase is an ubiquitous 100-120 kDa dimeric flavoprotein that catalyzes the reduction of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to reduced glutathione, using ß-nicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) as the hydrogen donor. Linearity was determined by taking Jurkat cell lysates at 40 x 106 cells/mL diluted to 200,000 and 20,000 cells/mL and mixing in the ratios given below. The measured activities were compared to the expected values based on the ratios used.",Antimetabolites,51111600,Antineoplastic agents,51110000,Drugs and Pharmaceutical Products,51000000

 Control:
 Enzye / Colour - HRP
 Extra Details:
 Stability - 4 years Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) is derived from the root extracts of the horseradish plant. HRP uses H2O2 to oxidize both organic and inorganic compounds. Antibody conjugates, used in ELISA, membrane & IHC applications, biosensors etc. can be developed when coupling HRP to antibodies. HRP is purified by large scale extraction and purification of horseradish roots by means of ultrafiltration, protein precipitation ion exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography, resulting in a highly purified, salt free lyophilized product. In ELISA, the main colorimetric substrate for HRP is TMB (3, 3', 5, 5'-tetramethylbenzidine). TMB produces a deep blue color during the enzymatic degradation of hydrogen peroxide by HRP, and the addition of an appropriate stop solution gives a clear yellow color that absorbs at 450nm

 Application:
 FluoroSpot
 Extra Details:
 The FluoroSpot assay is an inventive development of the ELISpot assay and uses fluorescent detection instead of colorimetric. This allows for simultaneous detection of several analytes, which is a major advantage. The human IFN-γ/IL-13 FluoroSpot kit is perfect for users who wish to have a convenient assay with minimized assay variability. It enables enumeration of cells secreting either one or both analytes and includes low fluorescent plates pre-coated with monoclonal capture antibodies, monoclonal detection antibodies, secondary reagents conjugated to fluorophores, a fluorescence enhancer and an anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody for co-stimulation. A polyclonal activator for human T cells (mAb CD3-2) is supplied as a positive control for cytokine secretion.

 Rockland's IsoMax[TM] Isotyping Kit compares to an ELISA-format isotyping assay. Results demonstrate outstanding correlation between these two assay formats. The ELISA required controls, an ELISA plate and substrate and took 8 hours of hands-on time to coat the plates, block and subsequently perform the assay using 12 different antibodies. The IsoMax[TM] Isotyping Kit pipetting time was 10 minutes; all 20 assays were run simultaneously. Each cassette was read at 5 minutes. The total hands-on time for the IsoMax[TM] Kit, including scoring of the results, was under twenty minutes.",Manual test kits and quality controls and calibrators and standards,41116100,Measuring and observing and testing instruments,41110000,Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment,41000000

 Manufacturer's Data Sheet: SySy_HS-452011
 Background:
 The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV2) is an enveloped positivesense single stranded RNA virus that has been identified in the beginning of 2020 (1). It infects human host cells by docking via its spike protein (S) to the ACE2 surface receptor (2) and can cause mild to very severe and even deadly Covid-19 courses (3).
 The very abundant Nucleocapsid or N-protein packages the viral RNA (4) and shares only little homology to other abundant members of the coronavirus family like NL63, 229E, HKU1 or OC43. This characteristic makes it a suitable target to discriminate between Covid-19 and other Coronavirus
 infections.
 Epitope:
 AA 16 to 25 from SARS-Cov-2 Nucleocapsid protein (UniProt Id: P0DTC9)
 ELISA:
 This antibody is suitable as capture antibody for sandwich-ELISA with cat. no. 452 111BT as detector antibody.

 Detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in brains of SARS-CoV-2 infected and non-infected K18-hACE2 transgenic mice.
 Lysate of HEK cells transfected with ALFA-tagged SARS-COv-2 Nucleocapsid have been probed with mouse anti-Nucleocapsid -Cov-2 (HS-452 011, dilution 1:1000), mouse anti-Nucleocapsid-Cov-1/2 (HS-452 11, dilution 1:1000) and rabbit anti-ALFATag (N1580, dilution 1:1000)
 Indirect immunostaining of PFA fixed brain sections from a SARS-CoV2 infected K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse in comparison to a non-infected control using the monoclonal anti-SARS-Cov-2 nucleocapsid antibody clone #4A8 (cat. no. HS-452 011, dilution 1:1000; red). Nuclei have been visualized by DAPI Staining (blue).
 Courtesy:The mice were housed and infected in cooperation with Prof. Kröger and Prof. Cicin-Sain at the HZI Braunschweig. As previously described, the mice show a strong infection in the brain. (Paul B McCray Jr, J Virol. 2007)

 Clones #4A8 and #53E2 were used in Sandwich ELISA settings to demonstrate the sensitivity of both antibodies. 50ng/well of clone #4A8 (cat. no. HS-452 011) was coated as capture antibody. Biotinylated clone #53E2 (cat. no. HS-452 111BT, 1:2000) was used as detection antibody. Different concentrations of recombinant nucleocapsid protein (SARS-CoV-2) (50ng/mL – 23.4 pg/mL) were tested in ELISA.

Kim et al. used this ELISA kit to measure the exosomal HMGB1 levels released from non-irradiated and gamma-irradiated melanoma cancer cells and demonstrated that exosomal HMGB1 stimulates immunogenic cell death (ICD).
 Immunogenic cell death (ICD)
 ICD is a form of cell death resulting in an activation of immune response. ICD is triggered by damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as exposure of calreticulin (CRT) at plasma membrane and release of HMGB1 and ATP. DAMPs contribute to the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), which present antigens to CD8 T cells, leading to activation of adaptive immunity.
 Accumulated reports reveal that irradiation or chemotherapy not only results to cancer cell death but also induces immunological anti-tumor responses via ICD. It is believed that the combination of ICD induction and other anti-cancer therapy is a promising approach for cancer treatment.
 HMGB1, a critical marker of ICD
 HMGB1 is one of DAMPs and important for ICD. The released HMGB1 binds to TLR4 to induce DC maturation, antigen presentation and subsequent cytotoxicity mediated by CD8 T cells.

Foreign antigens include bacteria, viruses, fungi, toxins, and any other material that originates outside the body. An immune response may also be raised against self-antigens, as exemplified by the destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells during type I diabetes. Antigens are essential to the production of antibodies for research. Following immunisation of a suitable host with the antigen of interest, an immune response results in antibody secretion by B-cells. Polyclonal antibody preparations are produced by purifying the secreted antibodies from the host’s serum via methods such as Protein A/G purification or antigen-specific affinity purification. Monoclonal antibody production is more involved, requiring fusion of the immunised host’s spleen cells with immortal myeloma cells, before isolation and expansion of antibody-producing clones. When selecting an antibody for a specific research application, it is important that researchers consider the nature of the antigen used to produce it. For example, if the intention is to use the antibody to detect a truncated protein which has been used as a positive control on a Western blot, and that protein is derived from the N-terminus of the full-length biomolecule, an antibody which was raised against the C-terminus is unlikely to achieve the desired immunostaining result. Antigen information is usually provided on antibody datasheets. Peptides A peptide is defined as being a short chain of two or more amino acids, covalently attached to one another by peptide bonds. There is no set length to distinguish a peptide from a protein, however peptides are considerably shorter than proteins and have a far less complex, typically linear, structure. Peptides occur naturally in the body, where they perform many essential functions. Examples of peptide hormones include insulin, glucagon and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which are involved in regulating blood glucose; ghrelin and peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY), which are important to control appetite; and bradykinin, which plays a key role in governing blood pressure. Other naturally-occurring peptides include the antimicrobial bacteriocins and microcins; and the lytic peptide melittin, a major component of bee venom which has been studied for its potential utility as an anti-cancer agent. Peptides usually exert a downstream function by binding to specific receptors. This results in activation of signaling cascades to produce a wide variety of effects. For example, peptide binding to a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) may cause the GPCR to interact with other membrane proteins involved in signal transduction to target ion channels in the cell membrane. Synthetic peptides are widely-used as immunogens during antibody production. Since they are often too small to elicit a substantial immune response, they are usually conjugated to a large carrier protein such as ovalbumin, bovine serum albumin (BSA) or keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH). Peptide immunogens often contain modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, glycosylation or methylation, allowing the production of antibodies suitable to study complex processes like protein activation or silencing. Recombinant proteins To meet demand for supply, proteins are often produced recombinantly using bacterial systems, insect cells, or mammalian cell lines such as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells or human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. This process involves cloning the gene of interest into a suitable vector, which is subsequently introduced to the host cells. The cell line is then expanded, and the protein purified. With recent advances in cloning and purification technologies, recombinant protein expression has become an established technique. In addition to improved yields, a further advantage of recombinant technology is that it provides the capacity to engineer desirable features into the protein. Tags may be introduced to facilitate protein purification or detection, or the protein may be modified in some way to improve solubility or bioactivity. Recombinant technology also affords the production of specific mutants, enabling an enhanced understanding of certain disease states. It can also be used to rapidly generate large numbers of proteins for immobilisation on protein-based microarrays. When choosing a recombinant protein for a research application, researchers should consider the exact nature of the protein to ensure sensible interpretation of results. For example, if a recombinant protein is intended for use as a positive control on a Western blot, it is important to note that a truncated protein will produce a detectable band which is smaller than the theoretical molecular weight. Tagged proteins Recombinant proteins are often engineered to contain a specific peptide or protein sequence, known as a tag. Affinity tags are exploited during protein purification, while tags can also be used to enhance protein stability or solubility. Epitope tags allow for protein detection, for example using anti-tag antibodies, whereas fluorescent tags aid visualisation. Commonly-used tags include glutathione S-transferase (GST), maltose-binding protein (MBP), calmodulin-binding peptide (CBP), polyhistidine (His), Myc, FLAG, HA, V5, SUMO and a wide variety of fluorescent dyes and proteins. Tags vary considerably in size, a factor which is especially of note if a tagged protein is intended for use as a Western blotting control. Tags are typically added to the N- or C-terminus of the encoded protein, since this approach is less likely to impact on protein folding, however it is also possible to place tags elsewhere within the protein structure. Many affinity tags include a recognition sequence to allow their removal following protein purification.",Libraries and related materials,41105900,Laboratory and scientific equipment,41100000,Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment,41000000

 The antigen of interest is detected with a specific antibody, which is labeled with an enzyme. The enzyme label later reacts with a substrate to yield a colored product. The enzymatic technique was developed with a similar principle to the IF technique, but they differ as an enzyme is used to label the antibody for the enzymatic method. The advantages of enzymatic IHC over IF IHC are:
 - A fluorescence microscope is not required
 - Accurate antigen location is enabled with better contrast ratio
 - Stained samples can be stored for a long time
 - Haematoxylin can be used as a counterstain, which enhances study of tissue morphology
 - The colorimetric signal can be easily identified and observed by light microscopy
 - Double or multiple stains can be implemented
 (i) Labeled-Enzyme Antibody
 For this method, the antibody used for antigen detection has been labeled with the enzyme before the reaction. After reacting with the targeted antigen, the labeled antigen forms an antigen-antibody complex where the enzyme catalyzes a substrate to yield an insoluble colored product. Subsequently, the product can be analyzed with microscopy or electron microscopy. The labeled-enzyme approach can be done by direct or indirect detections.
 [Figure 4. Direct vs. Indirect IHC Detection Methods.]
 (a) Direct Detection
 The direct method is a one-step staining method, which involves a labeled antibody (e.g. HRP-conjugated antibody) reacting directly with the antigen of interest. The antigen- antibody-HRP complex is then able to react with a DAB substrate for staining. While the direct method is simple, rapid and highly specific, it has low sensitivity and a limited range of primary antibodies that are directly labeled. Despite the shortcomings, the direct method is commonly applied to screen monoclonal antibodies before the large-scale manufacturing process.
 (b) Indirect Detection
 The indirect method is a two-step process, which involves an unlabeled primary antibody that binds to the target antigen in the sample and an enzyme-labeled secondary antibody that reacts with the primary antibody. The secondary antibody must be raised against the IgG of the animal species in which the primary antibody has been raised. For instance, if the primary antibody is rabbit anti-human IgG, the enzyme labeled secondary antibody could be goat anti-rabbit IgG.
 Comparing to the direct detection, the indirect detection has numerous advantages. First of all, only a relatively small number of standard conjugated secondary antibodies are needed for the indirect method. For example, a labeled secondary antibody raised against rabbit IgG, which can be purchased “off the shelf,” is useful with any primary antibody raised in rabbit. With the direct method, it would be necessary to label each primary antibody for every antigen of interest. Secondly, the indirect method
 has greater assay sensitivity. Moreover, various kinds of controls could be designed and applied with indirect detection.
 (ii) Unlabeled-Enzyme Antibody
 (a) Enzyme Bridge Method
 This method is based on the binding of an enzyme label to a target antigen through the antigen-antibody reactions of an immunoglobulin-enzyme bridge which consists of the following components in order:
 - Specific antiserum for the tissue antigen (AnTAn)
 - Antiserum against the immune globulin of the species for AnTAn
 - Specific antiserum prepared against the enzyme label in the same species as AnTAn
 - Enzyme label
 (b) Peroxidase-Anti-Peroxidase (PAP)Method
 This method involves immunization of a rabbit/goat/rat antibody with a HRP component to produce an anti-HRP rabbit/goat/rat antibody, which would then bind to another HRP part to form a stable polygon. The PAP approach excels due to its high sensitivity and low background for tissue staining.",Manual test kits and quality controls and calibrators and standards,41116100,Measuring and observing and testing instruments,41110000,Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment,41000000

 Based on the observed large national down turn in sales of ELISA related products, this article investigates the meaning and background of this observation. Upon request a comparison is made between ELISA and ELISPOT. This report explains the fundamental differences between the different types of ELISA and how they compare with ELISPOT.
 The occurrence in the literature of the different platforms is measured, and compared with the most cited alternatives to ELISA before the most used platforms are evaluated. Emerging alternatives may explain the downturn of ELISA product sales. The assays explained ELISA (Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay) is the method to detect an analyte (usually a protein) by means of an antibody in a 96 well format microtitre plate.
 The antibody is then reported back through a secondary antibody coupled to an enzyme that will cause an enzyme-specific substrate to stain the contents in the well (1). The level of staining is proportionate with the content of the analyte and can be measured through absorbance thus providing quantitative analysis. Newer ELISA-like techniques use fluorogenic, electrochemiluminescent, and quantitative PCR reporters to create quantifiable signals.
 These new reporters can have various advantages, including higher sensitivities and multiplexing (2, 3). In technical terms, these newer variants of assays are not strictly ELISA, as they are not ""enzymelinked"", but are instead linked to some non-enzymatic reporter. However, given that the general principles in these assays are largely similar, they are often referred to as ELISA
 There are three different approaches of ELISA:
 Direct & Indirect ELISA : With this approach, the analyte is coated in the microwells and detected either directly by an enzyme-conjugated primary antibody, or indirectly by making use of an enzymeconjugated secondary antibody.
 A well-established variant is the biotin-(strept-)avidin detection system when the primary is biotinylated, and instead of a secondary antibody, the streptavidin conjugated to an enzyme is used to bind to the biotinylated primary antibody. This system further enhances the sensitivity of the detection method.
 Sandwich ELISA : This approach is the most common method for quantitative analysis, as the analyte is captured from the matrix (plasma, serum, or other bodily fluid) by the primary antibody coated in the microwells. Here, the secondary antibody is also directed to the same analyte and report back on the captured molecules. A prerequisite to this approach is that the capturing and reporting antibodies need to bind to different parts of the analyte.
 Because there are two different primary antibodies involved, this approach potentially enhances the specificity of the detection. The reporting antibody is either conjugated itself for detection, or it is detected by a conjugated secondary antibody (that should not cross-react to the capture antibody)
 Competitive ELISA : In contrast to the above approaches, with a direct correlation between the obtained signal and the amount of analyte in the measured samples, the competitive assay allows added labelled reagent (either antibody or antigen) to compete with the unlabelled reagent in the sample to be analysed. Consequently, high amount of analyte would yield low reading (competed with the labelled added reagent) and a low amount of analyte would yield a high reading (labelled reagent finds low competition). Hence, the calibration curve would show a reverse orientation compared to the other approaches.
 ELISPOT (Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSPOT) is widely used for monitoring cellular immune responses (4), and has found clinical applications in diagnostics and in the monitoring of graft tolerance or rejection in transplant patients. The ELISPOT technique has proven to be among the most useful ways to monitor cell-mediated immunity, due to its sensitive and accurate detection of rare antigen-specific T cells (or B cells) and its ability to visualize single positive cells within a population of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).
 The microwells contain a PVDF membrane coated with a capture antibody specific to a cytokine. This cytokine would be released upon activation of a subset of lymphocytes among the PBMCs added and incubated in the microwells. Thus, the presence of such activated cells is detected and counted by the cytokines captured on the membrane at the locations of their origin, assayed as a standard sandwich ELISA after the cells have been washed away.
 Occurrence in literature
 This study has looked at the last 17 years of publications (2000-2017) as reported by Google Scholar, by recording the number of articles returned using the following key words: “ELISA” plus “Enzymelinked ImmunoSorbent”, “sandwich ELISA”, “competition ELISA” plus “competitive ELISA”, and “ELISPOT”.
 Certain papers may have used both keywords when meaning the same (such as “ELISA” and “Enzyme-linked ImmunoSorbent”), in which case such papers are counted double. In this analysis we made sure not to miss the papers where either one without the other is being used. The graph (figure 1) summarizes this study. It appears that the more generic “ELISA” and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent” has far out the highest frequency of occurrence, but its frequency peaked in the period 2006-2011 and is dramatically decreased since 2015.
 Although the frequency of “sandwich ELISA” is an order of magnitude lower than of “ELISA”/”enzyme-linked immunosorbent”, we see the down trend much earlier. Since Google Scholar returns research papers and patents, these frequencies need to be interpreted as a prelude of practical use. In other words, the practical use of such assays in a clinical routine only happens AFTER the research has been settled.
 Hence, while the research on such assays decline, their clinical applications may in fact rise, until the market saturates. The keywords “competition ELISA”/”competitive ELISA” and “ELISPOT” show a two-orders of magnitude lower frequency compared to “ELISA”/”Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent”.
 Although we see no significant decline, the much lower frequency of occurrence in the literature suggests that a lot of other assays are being used as alternative to these standard ELISA methods.
 Alternative assays in literature
 Next to research, ELISA is used in both preclinical and clinical applications for the quantitative analysis of analytes at large scale. However, alternatives are also being used. Many analytes, particularly smallweight molecules and non-protein molecules are better detected through other means as antibodies are not always available or fit for detection in ELISA.
 Other immune assays that serve as an alternative to ELISA are RIA (radioimmunoassay), Lateral Flow, and Multiplex Assay (Luminex beads). The latter isused for simultaneous detection of a set of different molecules in one go. In addition to such alternative immunoassays, aptamers are increasingly used as a replacement for antibodies (5). The Surface Plasmon Resonance (Biacore instrument) is a method to detect interactions between known molecules.
 The most versatile and non-immunological method of detection and identification (and with extreme high sensitivity) is the mass spectrometry. The frequency of articles featuring these alternatives have been scored through Google Scholar, in the same way as above for the various ELISA assay approaches (See figure 2).
 The results show strong growth for multiplex, aptamer and lateral flow, while research papers using mass spectrometry has been in decline in recent years, although still an order of magnitude higher than the others.
 Evaluation of different assays
 Reviews on immunoassays for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia reveal Important differences between classes of immunoassays, type of antibody specificity, thresholds, and manufacturers (6,7). Such variables apply to any analyte, thus there is a tendency to identify or develop more robust alternatives to the traditional immunoassays when possible.
 When not possible, the traditional methods (mainly ELISA) are adjusted, for example through a different way of detection (such as (electro-)chemiluminescence, fluorescence, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Surface Plasmon Resonance, ElectroHydroDynamics, or micro-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance), or through scaling down the sample size to address long processing time, high costs, poor user-friendliness, technical complexity, poor sensitivity and specificity associated with the traditional platforms (8).
 Over the last decade, various microfluidic-based Point-Of-Care platforms are developed for detecting nucleic acids, proteins, pathogens and cells (9). However, despite the advantages of reduced consumption of reagents and samples, operational automation, cheap unit cost, low power consumption, and compact size, success is still limited by fabrication materials, packaging method, purification/concentration, and reagent storage (9).
 But based on the literature (see above), the most cited method is Mass Spectrometry (figure 2). This method is the most powerful one for its versatility (it can be combined with a pre-step of a chromatography method or an immunoassay method), for its high sensitivity, and for the extreme low quantities of biological material that is required for analysis. This makes this instrument fit for the detection and identification of all types of molecules, varying from protein fragments to small steroids, lipids, carbohydrates, etc.
 However, the high costs and slow speed is a great limitation, especially for Point-of-Care applications. The other very popular alternative with the strongest growth (figure 2) is the multiplex immunoassay, as it enables high throughput identification of protein biomarkers which is sought after both for diagnostics and companion diagnostics. There is a fundamental distinction to be made between bead-based multiplexing, also known as Suspension Array Technology (in this context using capture antibodies linked to microbeads, for example Luminex) and homogenous sandwich-type multiplexing (using all reagents in solution, thus preventing washing steps).
 However, despite its increased popularity, there remain issues around high-throughput validation, matrix interference and cross-reactivity (10). Conclusions Immunoassays are being used based on scientific research, based on preclinical assessments, and based on routine clinical tests. In addition, immunoassays are used in human medical and veterinary context, and in forensic and environmental sciences. Only the results of scientific research will end up in scientific papers, so the assessments of frequency of the different assays in the scientific literature does not reflect accurately the demand in the market. All the use in clinical and pre-clinical applications would represent the major market without any reflection in scientific publications.
 That said, the rise and decline of certain assays in the literature do reflect the attention to these technologies in scientific research and the observed decline in mass spectrometry might indicate that most science are to be completed using such instrumentation. This could mean that the mass spectrometry still has an increased role to play in the day-to-day routines. The strong growth of multiplex, lateral flow and aptamer-based assays implies that the increased attention in scientific research is inevitably followed by increased demand when the resulting products are introduced in the day-to-day routine practice.
 It is worth noting that all the different types of ELISA have been accompanied with so many different alternatives, that the observed decline in sales of ELISA kits should be seen in this light. It is likely that certain analytes who were originally monitored by sandwich ELISA, are currently being monitored by lateral flow, by aptamer-based assays or by mass spectrometry. One another can be verified by looking at specific products that showed declined sales and to see if alternatives specific to the same marker have emerged in the market. Any comparison between ELISA platforms and ELISPOT is not very helpful as both serve completely different purposes.

VitaTaq polymerase produces single-stranded A-tails that can be used for TAcloning, VitaProof produces amplicons with blunt ends. HotStart HotStart polymerases are first activated upon the initial denaturation in the thermocycler. This allows for reaction setup at room temperature and increases specificity and yield. HotStart is favourable for complex DNA targets or multiplex applications or simply for convenient reaction setup. High Fidelity High fidelity PCR reagents work with proofreading polymerases that are capable of correcting falsely incorporated bases. They are the best choice if you have downstream applications for the amplified sequence like sequencing or cloning. Which reagent is right for your application? Gel Loading Products with a gel loading feature already contain a gel tracking dye to monitor the electrophoresis process and loading aid that makes the samples sink into the gel slots. Products with gel loading features are convenient to use as the addition of a separate loading dye after the PCR is not necessary. This saves time especially when processing a larger sample number. Multiplex Multiplex PCR is a highly complex procedure as several different primer pairs need to anneal properly and be amplified uniformly. PCR products for multiplex have a HotStart feature for increased specificity and an optimized buffer environment that allows for specific primer annealing and efficient amplification. Long Range In Long Range PCR, targets are often more then 5 kb long. Therefore, reagents for long amplification contain a fast polymerase to keep reaction times at a reasonable level and a special buffer formulation that protects the enzyme during prolonged periods at higher temperature and ensures specificity over long extension. 2X Mastermix A 2X mastermix is a convenient solution for fast, easy and reproducable reaction setup. The mastermix contains a polymerase, an optimized buffer environment and dNTPs. All there is to add is your primer and template. 2X mastermix formulations are favourable if your reaction conditions do not change much and if you want to process a large number of samples. Plant PCR Plant material is often tricky to analyze in PCR as the template material contains a lot of PCR inhibiting agents that often stick with the DNA even after DNA isolation. PCR reagents that are designed for plant-based PCR work with a special buffer composition, that renders many plant-based inhibitors harmless. In endpoint applications, the use of plant extracts or direct samples is possible for extra convenience. GC-Rich “GC-rich PCR” applies if your sequence of interest contains more than 60% GC base pairs. These sequences require higher temperatures for amplification that regular sequences and polymerases that can work under these suboptimal conditions. Dx Dx-Products contain VitaDx Taq, a highly pure polymerase with all favourable features of a Taq polymerase (robust, fast and efficient amplification) but free from human, bacterial, parasitic viral and fungal DNA. The missing DNA background can reduce non-specific amplification events and increases precision of PCR analysis, an important feature when performing bacterial genome analysis. PCC Products labeled „PCC“ are our own proprietary inventions. They contain enzymes that have been developed by our team of experts in-house. Through in-vitro evolution, we developed bio-engineered designer polymerases that exhibit exceptional features such as high fidelity and superior processivity. To help you choose the right enzyme for your application, we created a at-one-glance overview that shows you which product suits your application. 1 Best Choice - This is our recommendation for the indicated purpose. Choose this if you have a very specific application in mind. 2 Good option - Choosing this enzyme will most likely work for your purpose, but there might be a better choice. Choose this if you need the reagents for several different applications. 3 Suitable Option - means that a certain application might be possible with the enzyme but results will probably not be as good as they could be. X Not recommended - If a product is not recommended for a certain application, you will not get the results you want (e.g. blunt ends for TA-cloning).",Organic derivatives and substituted compounds,12352100,Compounds and mixtures,12350000,Chemicals including Bio Chemicals and Gas Materials,12000000

 Drawing on more than two decades of experience in medical printing, the UP-D711MD shares the image quality, economy and reliability that are hallmarks of other printers in the Sony range.
 Features:
 Compact, space-saving design for easy installation
 Dimensions of just 140 (W) 70 (H) 125 (D) mm and a weight of just 1kg give greater installation freedom in a wide range of medical environments. Recessed space for cable connectors simplifies installation, even in tight spaces where access is limited.
 Energy efficient design with low power consumption
 Energy consumption during printing and in standby is reduced by more than 50% compared with the previous model (UP-D897) – reducing power supply requirements in medical installations.
 Fast, easy paper loading
 Open the paper door and drop in a new paper roll. Then simply close the door, and the printer’s ready to use in moments.
 Choice of print modes
 Select from a choice of print sizes including 4:3 aspect ratio and panoramic 3:1 images that are ideal for dental applications. Print modes (including image orientation and reverse printing) can be set easily in the printer driver menu. Paper saving mode reduces media consumption when printing multiple images.
 Compliance with medical standards
 This product is distributed to the US and EU as a medical device and satisfies product safety standards (e.g. IEC 60601-1). For more details, please contact your nearest Sony sales office or an authorized dealer.
 High quality imaging
 Proven thermal printing technology by Sony assures high quality monochrome prints with a resolution of approximately 300 dpi and 8-bit (256 levels) processing.
 DC input
 The printer is powered directly from a connected ultrasound system’s 12-24V DC source, eliminating the need for additional AC outlets.
 Choice of print media
 Choose the most appropriate printing media for your needs. UPP-84HG High Glossy Printing Paper assures premium, near-photographic quality results. Reduce operating costs with UPP-84S High Quality Printing Paper that delivers excellent image quality at affordable cost.
 Image resize
 Image data can be automatically enlarged to fit a preset printing area, reducing data transfer times with small image file sizes.
 Print information
 Print information – including contrast, brightness, gamma and sharpness information – can be optionally added above each printed image.",Computer accessories,43211600,Computer Equipment and Accessories,43210000,Information Technology Broadcasting and Telecommunications,43000000

By adding a piece of touch glass substrate to the monitor and using a controller card to communicate with the driver in the control system, Accuview changed the use of a display from a simple readout device to an interactive control device. The Accuview open frame touchscreen monitors are used in projects in various industries. A public kiosk with a secured thick 6 mm vandal proof glass is a good example. Another example is a touchscreen monitor with a hard wired toggle on/off switch that controls the on/off function of the touch sensor for the cutting machine of a big lumber yard company. With more than 20 years in the touch screen monitor business, Accuview is able to share our expertise on the best touch technology for your next project with our open frame monitor. A custom cut touch sensor is also a viable option when you have a special project with no existing sensor in the market that can fit it. Accuview commits to long term support of our customers. We have fully backwards compatible drivers with the legacy support if we have to upgrade to the latest technology. Industrial devices can go through any number of rugged situations during their life cycle.

dcdba1eb-93e4-11eb-aa66-9b8d95e2171b,acrylicdesign.com,,Acrylic Design Associates helps hearing aid makers turn up the volume at retail,Acrylic Design Associates helps hearing aid makers turn up the volume at retail,https://www.acrylicdesign.com/blogs-news/acrylic-design-custom-hearing-aid-displays,Acrylic Displays,"In case you missed it, big changes are underway for the hearing aid market. As a result, hearing aid manufacturers and retailers are turning to Acrylic Design Associates for help in addressing new challenges and opportunities.
 What’s changing? In late 2021, the United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA) introduced guidelines (based on 2017 legislation) that allow a new category of hearing aids to be sold over the counter (OTC) without need for a visit to a doctor or audiologist. Once fully enacted, the change is expected to broaden hearing aid access through large U.S. retail networks to millions of Americans with hearing loss while dramatically reducing cost.
 About 37.5 million American adults suffer some level of hearing loss, but only 16% have ever used a hearing aid, according to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders. Prescription hearing aids can cost 4,000 -5,000, but allowing OTC purchases is expected to dramatically reduce the price.
 Needed: OTC Custom Hearing Aid Displays
 Up to now, hearing aid displays typically consisted of relatively simple fixtures located in audiologist offices. But as hearing aid manufacturers get ready for the new rules, they are realizing that retail channel-focused displays pose new challenges and opportunities. Manufacturers need a way to efficiently introduce products and explain their features while also being able to catch shoppers’ eyes. That’s where Acrylic Design comes in.
 “Acrylic Design has nearly 50 years of experience in creating hearing aid and medical device displays as well as manufacturing custom retail displays and retail environments” said Acrylic Design Associates CEO Bill McNeely, Jr. “That made us a natural fit for helping medical-based manufacturers and retailers navigate within the new rules by creating head-turning displays that best demonstrate their products.”
 As a full-service firm, Acrylic Design Associates provides end-to-end support for the entire process:
 Designing and engineering custom displays that include interactive product demos and all relevant information. Because of the variety of hearing aid types and fit, displays require a high level of customization and accuracy.
 Rapidly developing prototypes to confirm the most efficient specifications possible.
 Custom manufacturing displays that often include human-like ears, using state-of-the-art machining and printing technologies.
 Providing turnkey support for large-scale display assembly, kitting, warehousing and distribution – ensuring that projects are delivered where and when they need to be.
 Due to the need to rapidly introduce hearing aids at OTC retail locations, Acrylic Design is scaling up to match demand. In 2022, for example, the company is working with six different manufacturers and is quickly deploying 27,000 displays at more than 9,000 Walgreens and Best Buy stores across the United States. And that’s just for starters.
 One more benefit: Acrylic Design is offering its customers the opportunity to choose its Recrylic line of certified recycled acrylic in place of non-recycled acrylic. As the first line of 100% recycled acrylic to be widely available in North America and the first to be GRS and RCC certified, Recrylic helps retail display users to reduce CO 2 emissions and landfill use. Used acrylic displays can also be recycled as Recrylic, providing a sustainable, closed-loop lifecycle.
 “Solving client problems around topics like quality, scalability and sustainability is core to what Acrylic Design does best,” said McNeely. “It’s nice to be able to bring those together in a solution like this that will help so many people improve their hearing at an affordable cost.”

For Acrylic, the Answer is Yes.","Recrylic Provides Path for Collecting, Recycling Used Acrylic",https://www.acrylicdesign.com/blogs-news/recrylic-provides-path-for-collecting-recycling-used-acrylic,Acrylic Dividers,"Is plastic really recyclable? According to various studies, most plastic ends up in landfills. National Geographic, for example, reports that 79% of all plastic ever created has ended up in landfill or the natural environment, with only 9% being recycled.
 For many businesses, however, the good news is that one type of plastic – acrylic – is 100% recyclable. Introduced by Acrylic Design Associates in early 2022, Recrylic, the world’s only line of certified recycled acrylic sheets, is helping to ensure that used acrylic gets collected and recycled wherever possible.
 Acrylic (sometimes known as plexiglass) is a commonly used material – seen in everything from luxury retail displays to artwork to architectural elements and more. For designers, architects and engineers, acrylic is a popular alternative to glass and other materials due to its durability, versatile characteristics and affordable cost. Unfortunately, though, it also takes about two tons of petroleum products to produce one ton of non-recycled virgin acrylic.
 Illuminated retail display built with acrylic
 “For years, our clients have asked for a recycled acrylic that looks, performs and costs the same as virgin acrylic,” said Acrylic Design Associates CEO Bill McNeely Jr. “ESG commitments are driving changes in marketing, design and construction choices – and using recycled materials is one way that our clients can meet their sustainability goals.”
 Working with multiple suppliers, McNeely and his team were able to bring a new product to market that met all client requirements and is both 100% recycled and 100% recyclable. That makes Recrylic a natural alternative to virgin acrylic and other materials.
 Collecting Used Items for Recycling
 Used acrylic comes from two primary sources:
 Scrap created during the fabrication of acrylic items
 Used items at the end of their useful life
 Acrylic Design collects that scrap, sorts it and sends materials for recycling as Recrylic or into other recycling streams, as appropriate. And unlike other plastics that may degrade after 2-3 cycles, Recrylic can be recycled indefinitely, creating a closed-loop lifecycle.
 An Acrylic Design study in 2021 found that a third of respondents were sending at least half of their used fixtures to landfill. And 73% were interested in an option to collect and recycle their used acrylic.
 Starting this year, Recrylic has begun to do just that. One recent example found Recrylic collecting more than a ton of protective dividers used by United Healthcare pharmacy-based kiosks. And conversations are under way with a number of leading retailers on the best way to collect their used materials for recycling.
 Acrylic Design Associates recently collected more than a ton of acrylic dividers used with popular pharmacy kiosks.
 In the first nine months of 2022, Acrylic Design already shipped more than 60 tons of scrap to be processed as recycled acrylic. McNeely expects that number to grow steadily as more companies become aware of Recrylic – and also seek ways to recycle their used items.
 Making an Impact
 The recycling numbers are starting to add up. According to a pending study commissioned by Acrylic Design, producing each pound of virgin acrylic requires about 3.3 pounds of petroleum-based products. That means that producing 60 tons of virgin acrylic, for example, would require about 198 tons of fossil fuels. Using that much fossil fuel releases about 619 tons of CO2 into the atmosphere – or the equivalent of about 121 cars driven for an entire year.
 Producing an equivalent amount of Recrylic removes about 85% of CO2 emissions from the equation – while also reducing landfill and water use. At the same time, Recrylic looks, performs and costs the same as virgin acrylic. That makes choosing Recrylic over virgin acrylic an easy choice for many clients.
 “We are committed to helping our clients meet and exceed their sustainability goals,” said McNeely. “Using recycled materials while also providing a mechanism for collecting and recycling used items is just one of the many ways we can do so.”

 What’s a Rich Text element?
 The rich text element allows you to create and format headings, paragraphs, blockquotes, images, and video all in one place instead of having to add and format them individually. Just double-click and easily create content.
 Static and dynamic content editing
 A rich text element can be used with static or dynamic content. For static content, just drop it into any page and begin editing. For dynamic content, add a rich text field to any collection and then connect a rich text element to that field in the settings panel. Voila!
 How to customize formatting for each rich text
 Headings, paragraphs, blockquotes, figures, images, and figure captions can all be styled after a class is added to the rich text element using the ""When inside of"" nested selector system.",Paints and primers,31211500,Paints and primers and finishes,31210000,Manufacturing Components and Supplies,31000000

 Sleep Number uses acrylic fixtures in its more than 600 retail stores to display product information
 The company was interested in a recycled alternative to help achieve corporate goals for sustainable sourcing
 Solution
 Sleep Number chose to test 1/2"" Recrylic certified recycled acrylic to provide attractive protection over product information sheets
 Recrylic offered the same attractiveness, performance and cost as virgin acrylic, without the need for using raw petroleum
 Results
 The initial test included fixtures at 50 stores – with a total weight of about 18 pounds per store
 Eco-friendly savings for this test about 6 barrels of oil, or 2.8 tons of CO2
 Assuming a rollout of 600 locations, that would generate about 34 tons of CO2 saved – or the equivalent of taking 7.4 cars off the road, for a full year – just from one fixture

 The vision for Arctic Glacier Premium Ice is carved from the entrepreneurial spirit of our founders more than 140 years ago in Manitoba, Canada.
 Our story begins in 1882 when Charles H. McNaughton purchased two horses, a couple of wagons and an icehouse on Fountain Street in Winnipeg, founding The Arctic Ice Company. McNaughton and his business partner James S. Nicholson cut blocks of ice from the Red River. The massive blocks of ice were insulated in sawdust and stored until ready to deliver via horse-drawn wagons and sold to the citizens of Winnipeg.
 In 1901, the Company made its first acquisition, merging with Winnipeg Ice Company. As Arctic Ice expanded, it re-imagined its operational approach. To meet increasing demand, the Company cut ice from different rivers and lakes, leveraged cars holding 40 tons per carload, and barges, holding 250 tons per load, to transport ice to their customers throughout the region.
 When water levels dropped and Mother Nature proved an unreliable supplier, the enterprising team quickly pivoted to manufacturing ice. Purchasing 56 acres of land in St. Boniface, Manitoba and they poured 10 million gallons of water into a man-made reservoir. Using mechanical saws, the Company harvested 110,000 tons of ice in one year and stored it in their buildings and stables.
 The demand for natural ice began decreasing by 1950. Innovative from the outset and evolving with
 the changing times, the Arctic Ice Company no longer harvested ice from natural sources and in 1954 made its last house delivery. The Company honors their historic Winnipeg business serving as title sponsor of the Arctic Glacier Winter Park at the Forks in Manitoba. Marking the place where the Red and Assiniboine Rivers meet and where the Company once harvested its ice from, the Forks is now a vibrant, mixed-use recreational area and jewel of community welcoming over 4 million visitors annually and contributing 1.26 million a year to the local economy.
 Over the course of its first 100 years in business, the Arctic Ice Company continued to evolve, establishing itself as Canada’s largest ice manufacturer, employing 800 Associates, boasting a fleet
 of over 400 trucks, and delivering over 100 million bags of ice annually throughout North America.
 In 1996, Arctic Ice Company is rebranded Arctic Glacier Premium Ice.
 In the 25 years following the rebrand, Arctic Glacier Premium Ice has successfully unified over 150 regional and family-owned ice companies whose strong reputations for quality products and customer service has enabled the Company to emerge as North America’s foremost provider of certified,
 high-quality ice products and services. Beginning in 1997 the Company entered the U.S., making several acquisitions throughout the Midwest. In the early 2000’s, the Company began expanding eastward with key acquisitions in New York and Pennsylvania. Between 2006 and 2007, the Company expanded its reach to include the U.S. West coast, consolidating several regional ice companies and the acquisition of California’s market leader Union Ice Company whose legacy also traces back to 1882.
 Recent acquisitions enabling new market entries include Star Ice and Fuel of Washington, Superior Ice Company of Indiana, Southeastern Ice of Oklahoma, AC Ice Company of Colorado, Getchell Bros of Maine, and Brookline Ice Company of Massachusetts. In 2022, the company opened its newest
 state-of-the-art production facility in Montreal, Canada.
 Backed by the financial wherewithal of The Carlyle Group, the Company continuously makes focused investments in technology, leading talent, and environmentally sustainable practices to create the most value for their customers and support the livelihoods of their Associates and the communities where they operate.
 From those early, humble beginnings as a one icehouse, two horse company to its position today as an international industry-leading powerhouse, Arctic Glacier produces and delivers over 2.5 billion pounds of ice annually to more than 75,000 customer locations across the U.S. and Canada and employs over 5,000 Associates from its more than 100 locations across North America.

 Request Pricing and Information
 All-Around Extinguishing Agent
 The CellBlockEX granulate is very well suited for use in industrial facilities, production operations, data processing centers, archives, warehousing and transportation. Since it is an electrical insulator, it’s also ideal for use in the energy storage and supply sector (i.e., transformer station protection). CellBlockEX has a low dust content, tolerates frost, and is easily removable.
 Lithium-Ion Battery Fire Protection
 The increasing demand for stored energy also results in higher fire protection requirements during production, transportation, storage, and disposal or recycling of lithium-ion batteries and cells. CellBlockEX is ideal as a dry lithium battery fire extinguisher, and is especially well suited for processes where the use of extinguishing water or foam is not possible (i.e., the aging of lithium-ion batteries).
 Dangerous Goods Packaging
 Transporting freight via road, air or sea – anyone shipping dangerous goods has to observe numerous regulations. Transporting damaged or defective lithium-ion batteries is problematic and special measures are required. CellBlockEX meets the fundamental requirements for fire protection filler. Accordingly, it may be used for conforming special transport containers and it exceeds DOT requirements for lithium-ion battery transport.
 Fire Prevention with CellBlockEX
 Preventive fire protection encompasses steps taken in advance to counteract the outbreak and spread of fires, and to limit their impact as much as possible. In technical fire protection, CellBlockEX can be used as a fire suppressing material by permanently filling cavities, suspended ceilings, cable shafts, lines and pipes.
 CellBlockEX as a Packaging Filler
 CellBlockEX fillers protect packaged goods against damage, vibration and impact. It is lightweight, binds liquids, and is environmentally friendly. For shipping hazardous liquids (i.e., laboratory chemicals, bases, acids, paint thinner, or similar) transportation in a dangerous goods unit with a non-combustible filler/binding agent to prevent leaks is prescribed. CellBlockEX offers secure fire and leak protection when used as a packing filler for transporting dangerous substances.
 CellBlockEX used in conjunction with CellBlock Storage or Transport Containers
 The CellBlock Max Case is the safest way to store large format lithium-ion batteries.
 CellBlockEX used in shipping and storage containers offers fire and leak protection for the safe transport of hazardous materials. It is an ideal loose-fill fireproof outer packing, whether you’re using our Storage Cases or HazMat Drums .

 Connections - dB Noise Reduction",https://www.dbnoisereduction.com/case-studies/nitrogen-purge-system.php,Noise Control System,"Problem:
 Global manufacturer utilizing an extremely large autoclave to produce large, critical components required for final assembly. In this case, the Autoclave is used cure materials with extreme heat and pressure for a prescribed period of time. To facilitate quick extraction of the material from the autoclave, the system is rapidly cooled with nitrogen. The nitrogen is then purged from the system producing a high level of harmful noise for a period of time.
 The existing silencer system (from a different silencer manufacturer) did not provide a safe level of noise reduction for the duration of the purge process. The noise measured at the existing silencer was 125 dB - extremely loud and unsafe. Since the existing noise control system was ineffective, it needed to be replaced rapidly to coincide with the factory's tight production schedule.
 Solution:
 The dB Noise Reduction team analyzed the problem. Challenges in design needed to factor the extreme noise levels, heat and pressure. The solution was dB Noise Reduction's Nois-eNvelope Enclosed Silencer Noise Control System , which removed the ineffective silencer from the system and installed a new silencer and enclosure around it to control the extreme noise produced by the nitrogen purge process. The resulting noise level was measured at 95 db - down 30 dB from the pre-existing 125 dB.

 Noise Reduction",https://www.dbnoisereduction.com/faq.php,Noise Reduction,"Acoustic fundamentals:
 What is sound?
 What humans perceive as sound is the propagation of pressure waves through a medium. The speed of sound varies from medium to medium, with denser mediums having faster wave propagation. Different sound frequencies are perceived as different tones. Any undesirable sound is referred to as noise.
 What is noise?
 Quite simply, noise is any undesirable sound.
 What is noise reduction?
 Noise reduction is any targeted reduction to sound pressure levels implemented using noise reduction equipment.
 What is sound pressure?
 Sound is a pressure wave that propagates through a medium (typically air). Like any wave, sound waves have hills and valleys corresponding to areas of high and low pressure. The amplitude of the sound wave (distance from atmospheric pressure to the high or low points on the wave) is the sound pressure and is typically expressed in units of Pascals or pounds per square inch.
 What is sound power?
 Sound power represents the total energy of a sound. It is independent of distance and the acoustics of the surrounding space. You cannot hear sound power; you can only hear sound pressure.
 What is sound frequency?
 Sound frequency is the number of oscillations of a sound wave in a set period of time. From a human's perspective, these frequencies can be equated to the pitch of a sound. Sound frequency is measured in number of oscillations per second, or Hertz. Humans can hear between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz, with lower pitched sounds having a lower frequency.
 What is a decibel?
 A decibel is a logarithmic measure of sound pressure or sound power levels. It is based on the threshold of human hearing. As a result, 0 dB is the quietist environment a human can perceive. On the other extreme, 130 dB is the loudest sound a human can hear without experiencing immediate physical pain. Since it is a logarithmic scale, every 3 dB increase in sound level requires twice the amount of sound power or sound pressure to produce.
 What is the difference between dB and dBA?
 Humans do not hear all frequencies equally. Sound levels in the low frequency end of the spectrum are reduced. In order to account for this, different weightings have been created to give a loudness measurement that takes into account how the human ear actually perceives sound. In North America, the most common of these weightings is the ""A"" weighting. Values that have been corrected using the ""A"" weighting system are shown using units of dBA. Values not corrected to account for human hearing are written using units of dB.
 What is a ""Sabin""?
 A Sabin is a unit of measure of sound absorption. It is calculated by multiplying a material's absorption coefficient by the square footage of the absorptive material.
 What is sound absorption?
 Sound absorption is the process by which sound waves incident on an absorptive material are converted in whole or in part to heat, reducing the overall noise level.
 What is the absorption coefficient?
 The absorption coefficient is a ratio of the sound absorbed by a material to the incident sound acting on the material. Absorption coefficients are used in determining how ""soft"" or ""loud"" a room is with respect to sound.
 How does distance relate to noise level?
 Sound pressure levels decrease with the square of the distance. So doubling the distance to a sound source results in a 6 dB decrease in sound levels.
 What is dynamic insertion loss (DIL)?
 Dynamic insertion loss is the difference in sound levels at a given point before and after the installation of noise reduction equipment while under flow. It is essentially a measure of the amount of noise that the silencer or other equipment is removing. The silencer DILs are specified for each of the standard octave bands and are guaranteed for every piece of noise abatement equipment dB Noise Reduction designs and manufactures.
 What is a noise reduction coefficient (NRC)?
 A noise reduction coefficient (NRC) is a single number that represents an average of the sound absorption coefficients in the 250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, and 2000 Hz octave bands. Detail of its calculation can be found in the ASTM C-423 standard.
 What are transmission losses?
 Transmission losses are defined as the difference between incident sound power coming into contact with the surface of a material and the sound power emitted by the material its opposite surface. It is essentially the amount of sound lost when travelling through an obstruction. Generally speaking, denser materials have higher transmission losses than lighter materials. Transmission losses are measured in decibels (dB).
 What is a sound transmission class (STC)?
 A sound transmission class (STC) is a single number that estimates the performance of an acoustic barrier in certain common noise reduction applications. STC numbers are determined based on the ASTM 413 standard.
 What is breakout noise?
 Breakout noise is undesirable sound that is caused by the transmission of sound through the walls of a duct, building or other enclosure. It can normally be remedied by applying absorptive cladding or erecting acoustical barriers.
 What is self generated noise?
 Self generated noise is noise typically caused by gas turbulence at the inlet and/or discharge of a silencer, and should be taken into account when selecting a silencer.
 What is the near field?
 The near field is defined as an area close to the noise source where small changes in position can result in large variations in noise level. In this area, the noise is essentially interacting with itself and its surroundings in such a way that the noise field is extremely chaotic and unpredictable.
 What is the far field?
 The far field refers to any location outside of the near field. In this area, the sound level is far more orderly and predictable and drops off at or near the theoretical rate of 6 dB for every doubling in distance (the Inverse Square Law). Noise measurements are typically taken in this area.
 What does the term ""free field"" mean?
 Free field is typically used when referring to measured or calculated sound level values. It indicates that the values in question were obtained by assuming that the surroundings of the noise source do not cause any meaningful changes to the noise propagation. In other words, it is assumed that the sound level drops off at the theoretical rate of 6 dB for every doubling of distance (the Inverse Square Law).
 What does the expression ""Flanking Noise"" mean?
 When noise arrives by means of flanking, the noise is travelling along, over or around a noise control surface, silencer casing, or other device on its way to the listener.
 What is pressure drop?
 Technically, pressure drop is defined as the difference between the pressure between any two points in a gas flow. Changes to or increases in surface geometry, flow velocity, surface roughness, path changes, etc. can all cause increases in pressure drop. For practical purposes, pressure drop can be thought of as a measure of the resistance the fluid flow has to overcome. The more resistance the flow has to overcome, the higher the pressure drop. Pressure drop is a pressure and is usually measured in inches or millimeters of water.
 All about silencers:
 What is a silencer?
 A silencer is a passive noise abatement device that is typically placed on the inlet or outlet of a noise producing piece of equipment. It allows the air or other gas to flow freely while providing a reduction in sound levels.
 Why do I need a silencer?
 There are government noise regulations that must be complied with in and around the workplace. These regulations stipulate the allowable noise levels for unprotected workers in the workplace, as well as the allowable noise at the perimeter of a property.
 Aren't silencers only used on large fans?
 Silencers are often required on smaller fans and other types of equipment in addition to large fans. As well as designing and fabricating silencers for fans, dB Noise Reduction also designs and fabricates silencers for steam and natural gas venting (vent or blowdown silencers), for engine exhaust (mufflers), gas turbine intakes and exhausts, and for hazardous gasses and/or particulate-laden gasses.
 What type of silencer do I need?
 There are many options available for most applications, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Most of the time the physical arrangement of the equipment being silenced will also determine or limit the silencer selections available. The frequencies to be silenced and the composition and velocity of the flow will also play a role. Please contact us to discuss your specific situation.
 What are reactive silencers/mufflers?
 Reactive sound reduction devices are devices that are especially effective at reducing low frequency sound, although they can be designed to target different frequency ranges. They consist of a number of plates and/or tuned perforated pipes. This type of silencer is designed around the principles of Helmholtz resonators and expansion chambers. They essentially work by reflecting the sound around indefinitely until much of its energy is lost.
 What are absorptive silencers/mufflers?
 Absorptive silencers are the most common silencers and contain an acoustically absorptive material, usually fiberglass or mineral wool. This material is contained behind perforated metal and removes energy from the sound waves as they propagate through the unit. This type of system reduces sound levels across a broad range of frequencies and can be configured to provide maximum sound level reduction in a specific frequency range.
 Can reactive and absorptive silencers/mufflers be combined?
 Yes! In fact, combining reactive and absorptive sound reduction methods works extremely well to create a device that is excellent at reducing both low and mid-to-high frequencies.
 How loud can my equipment be before I require a silencer?
 Complying with government regulations usually determines how loud something can be. These regulations often stipulate what level of noise a worker can be exposed to without proper hearing protection, or what noise level is permitted at the perimeter of your property, for example. Typically, most companies strive to meet 85 dBA within the workplace.
 What size silencer do I need?
 A silencer's size is based on several criteria that (with the exception of connection size) all influence each other. These criteria are:
 Connection size required - The most cost effective way to make a silencer is to have the dimensions of the silencer match the size of its inlet/outlet connections.
 Flow velocity - Typically in order for a traditional silencer to function properly, the flow velocity inside the silencer passage should not exceed 6000 feet per minute. This means that for typical applications, the flow entering the silencer should not be higher than 4000 feet per minute. Higher flow velocities result in larger pressure drops and more wear on the equipment.
 Desired pressure drop - If a very small pressure drop is required, the cross-sectional area of the silencer will have to increase to allow for a lower flow velocity.
 Desired sound level reduction - Increasing the length of a silencer increases its overall noise reduction capability. However, the longer a silencer is, the higher its pressure drop.
 Do I need a standard or heavy duty silencer?
 This really depends on what your particular application is and what sort of environment your silencer will be operated in. We would be happy to discuss your specific needs and show you various options.
 Do silencers have to be designed for their specific application?
 While choosing a silencer from a catalog can sometimes yield the desired results, in order to get a properly designed silencer with consistent guaranteed results and as low a pressure drop as possible, a custom designed piece of equipment is the best choice.
 What information do I need to get a silencer sized for my particular application?
 In order to have a silencer sized, you will need to supply the following information:
 The noise characteristics of your equipment (noise level at each of the eight octave bands). This is usually available from the equipment manufacturer but can also be measured on site.
 The amount of reduction desired or the noise target at a specific location relative to the noise source (ie: 85 dBA at 3 feet directly in front of silencer inlet).
 Maximum allowable pressure drop.
 The flow properties (flow rate, density, temperature, etc.).
 Available space and geometry/orientation of connections.
 Size and type of connections and hole pattern required (if any).
 Material and finish of silencer (if desired).
 What connection types do you offer?
 The typical connection types offered include ANSI flanges, plate flanges, angle flanges, blow pipe flanges and slip fit connections. If you require another connection type, it can certainly be arranged. Please contact us .
 Will you match my flange hole pattern?
 Yes we will. Aside from ANSI and blow pipe flanges which already have standard hole patterns, we will custom drill any other type of flange to match your needs.
 How much maintenance do silencers require?
 Silencers require very little maintenance. Generally, an annual inspection to ensure that the paint or other protective exterior coating is still intact is all that is required, touching up where necessary. For flows where particulate is present and may accumulate, the inside of the silencer should be checked and cleaned periodically if required. Special access doors can be added to accommodate this.
 What is the average equipment life of a silencer?
 A silencer running under normal conditions and with a clean airstream should last between 10 and 20 years of continuous operation. With a dirty airstream, the silencer life will be shortened.

 Q: How is a ductless mini-split different from central air?
 A : Instead of blowing air through ducts from a central air handler, a ductless mini-split places the air handler directly inside the occupied room. Unlike a central air system, which has a single air handler, multi-zone mini-splits have several independent air handlers.
 Q: What's the difference between single and multi-zone ductless mini-splits?
 A : Single zone mini-splits have one indoor air handler and one outdoor condenser. A multi-zone system uses a single condenser to provide cooling to several indoor air handlers, each of which is connected by a refrigerant line set to the condenser. This allows the system to cool more space, and to cool separate spaces independently with independent thermostats.
 Q: Does a ductless mini-split’s air handler have to hang on the wall?
 A : No. The air handler should be installed above floor level, but it can be recessed in the ceiling or hidden entirely with a short piece of ductwork.
 Q: How can I tell which mini-split heat pumps are suitable for colder climates?
 A : Heating seasonal performance factor (HSPF) is an industry-standard measure that describes how efficient a heat pump is over the full heating season, based on testing methods developed by the Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute. Energy Star recommends looking for an Energy Star certified unit with an HSPF above 12 if low-temperature performance is a concern.",Ducts,40141900,Fluid and gas distribution,40140000,Distribution and Conditioning Systems and Equipment and Components,40000000

 Flap wheels are made of multiple abrasive sheets attached to a core for fabricating, deburring, cleaning, polishing, and finishing jobs in metalworking applications. The sheets wear away during jobs, constantly exposing fresh abrasive coating to provide an even finish. Each grit flap comes in contact with the workpiece at a slightly different angle, which prevents scratches. Because abrasive flap wheels conform to the shape of the surface material, they are commonly used to finish complex shapes and tight contours on a workpiece. Flap wheels attach to grinders, drills, impact wrenches, or handheld rotary tools. They are either pre-mounted on a central hub, or unmounted for attaching to a compatible arbor.

 Sanding discs are circular abrasive discs that remove material, light defects, corrosion, paint, and rust from wood, metal, and plastic surfaces. They attach to disc sanders, angle grinders, or handheld rotary tools, and they allow for good control of a workpiece, as workers can see the workpiece at all times when sanding discs are in use. Coarse grit removes material such as welds on metal or mill marks on wood, while fine grit buffs out tool marks and evens out edges. Adhesive-backed and hook-and-loop discs allow for quick switchouts of sanding discs. Industrial sanding disc rolls keep fresh discs on-hand in applications requiring heavy or frequent sanding, such as in woodshops and production facilities.

Exhaust fans force out stale air and pull in fresh, clean air for a more comfortable environment. Combusion air intake systems control the amounts of outside air for proper combustion of oil and gas heating appliances and for more efficent heating. Duct fans increase capacity to HVAC systems, while ductwork circulates air throughout a building. Energy recovery ventilators regulate the temperature and humidity of the fresh air they pull in and can improve indoor air quality. Kitchen and range hoods maintain proper ventilation in kitchen and cooking areas. Portable blowers and carpet dryers quickly dry wet carpeting, rugs, and other flooring surfaces. Direct-drive and belt-drive tubeaxial fans are used to help exhaust contaminated or hot air created in industrial applications, and supply air to help cool or pressurize interior spaces.

They're commonly used to reduce moisture and remove smoke and odors in restaurants, residences, shop and production floors, and commercial buildings. Exhaust fans mount through a cutout in a roof or wall. Belt-driven exhaust fans handle large volumes of air at low static pressures. They run more quietly and allow greater control over fans speeds than direct-drive exhaust fans. Direct-drive exhaust fans have their motor mounted on the fan shaft, so they are more compact and have fewer moving parts than belt-driven fans.

Linear light bulbs are straight, tube-shaped bulbs with bases on both ends. U-bend light bulbs are tubed-shaped linear bulbs that have been bent into a U shape to allow them to fit into fixtures where there is limited space for a bulb. Circline and plug-in (PL) bulbs plug into matching sockets on compatible light fixtures. Miniature light bulbs are small enough to fit in tight spaces and don't draw a lot of energy. Decorative bulbs have eye-catching shapes, colors, and other features. Spot, flood, and reflector light bulbs and lamps direct light through the top of the bulb to increase the bulb's light output and shape the beam of light.
 Light bulbs and lamps install into light fixtures to provide general area lighting or more focused lighting for specific applications. Standard light bulbs fit a large variety of light fixtures. Linear light bulbs are straight, tube-shaped bulbs with bases on both ends. U-bend light bulbs are tubed-shaped linear bulbs that have been bent into a U shape to allow them to fit into fixtures where there is limited space for a bulb. Circline and plug-in (PL) bulbs plug into matching sockets on compatible light fixtures. Miniature light bulbs are small enough to fit in tight spaces and don't draw a lot of energy.

 Grease guns dispense grease on equipment where a permanent lubrication system can't be attached, such as automobiles, farm equipment, and some industrial machinery. They keep parts well lubricated and help extend the life of equipment. Grease guns also allow grease to be applied exactly where needed to avoid waste. Air-operated (also called air-powered or pneumatic) grease guns require less effort to operate than manual guns and are less likely to run out of power than battery-powered guns. They're well suited for large-scale lubrication tasks. Cordless battery-powered grease guns are more efficient and require less effort to use than manual guns. They're also more portable than air-powered guns, making them ideal for applications where machinery must be maintained in the field. Manual grease guns dispense grease with a simple hand pump and are suitable for applications with low fill volumes and few lubrication points.

 Cutting oils and additives cool, lubricate, and help prevent damage to machinery, tools, or workpieces in machining operations. Direct-application cutting lubricants are applied directly to workpieces or cutting tools. Electrical-discharge machining fluids conduct an electrical charge to remove small amounts of material from a submerged workpiece. Cutting oils lubricate parts during cutting, threading, grinding, or milling. Way oils reduce friction between sliding parts to prevent wear and allow them to move smoothly. Machining fluid additives control bacterial growth or foaming that can contaminate machining fluids or reduce their effectiveness. Cutting tool cleaners remove lubricants, grease, and coolants from cutting tools to prevent damage to the tools and extend their life.

The pallet jacks' handle must be manually operated to raise, lower, or hold their forks. Also known as semi-electric pallet jacks, these pallet jacks typically weigh less and are more compact than fully powered pallet jacks, which makes them easier to maneuver in narrow aisles, freight elevators, trailers, and other tight spaces. The pallet jacks' motor is powered by a rechargeable battery. Drive controls and a battery-charge indicator are located on the tiller handle for quick access.

These flow-control devices handle pressurized water directly from a plumbing supply line for flushing high-traffic fixtures (more than 30 flushes per day) commonly found in public, commercial, and institutional restrooms. Flush valves (also called flushometers) are complete assemblies that connect to a water supply and the spud of a toilet, urinal, or sink. They house the mechanism that controls water flow through the valve along with the manual or automatic actuator that initiates the flush. They're used for new installations or replacing existing flush valves. Flush-valve retrofit kits include parts for converting an existing flushometer from manual to automatic operation. They're typically selected with a gallons-per-flush rating that matches the existing flushometer to help ensure proper clearing of the toilet bowl.

 Bearings extend the working life of wheels, pulleys, and other rotating parts by reducing friction and enabling parts to move smoothly. Also called slewing rings or slewing bearings, they are installed between two surfaces to keep parts aligned and support axial and radial loads. Axial (thrust) bearings support loads parallel to the axis of the shaft, such as those exerted by a table supporting a weight. Radial bearings support rotating wheels and other applications where the force of the load is perpendicular to the shaft. Ball bearings are used with applications that have high axial loads and low-to-moderate radial loads. Mounted bearings (bearing units) have a bearing inside a housing unit to ensure a secure fit and mount. Sleeve and clip bearings support high loads, have no moving parts, and require lubricant to allow the shaft to turn smoothly. Spherical bearings and spherical rod ends are used on articulating joints and when the bearing must accommodate for axial misalignment.

Bearing guides, guide rails, shafts, and carriages (slides) align components to reduce friction and provide smooth, precise movement. Magnetic capping headsets apply caps to small bottles. Sleeve bearings, and mounted and unmounted linear bearings, reduce wear caused by friction and evenly distribute loads for use with heavy loads. Screws are used with screw jacks, presses, and linear actuators at low-to-moderate speeds under heavy loads.",Actuators,31251500,Pneumatic and hydraulic and electric control systems,31250000,Manufacturing Components and Supplies,31000000

 Drum pumps are hand-operated, electric-powered, or air-powered devices that suction fluids out of drums, barrels, pails, and intermediate bulk containers (also known as IBCs or totes). They reduce the risk of spills and minimize product waste by allowing fluid to be removed from containers that are too heavy or large to be tipped for pouring. The intake hose or tube of a drum pump fits through the opening of a container to dip into the fluid within. The drum pump's pumping mechanism draws fluid through the intake and discharges it from the pump's outlet. The parts of the pump in contact with fluids being pumped should be compatible to avoid damaging the pump or contaminating pumped fluids. Drum pumps are commonly used in agriculture, manufacturing, sanitation, and fleet maintenance operations for dispensing fuels or other fluids and transferring fluids to smaller containers.

 Electrical stimulation or neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is a technique used to elicit a muscle contraction using electrical impulses. Electrodes, controlled by a unit, are placed on the skin over a predetermined area. Electrical current is then sent from the unit to the electrodes and delivered into the muscle causing a contraction.

 Research shows that sensory electrical stimulation (SES) can be an effective treatment strategy for improving sensory and motor function. With SES, the main goal is to maximize input by providing stimulation at very low-level (i.e., without producing a muscle contraction). Studies show that providing SES to an impaired nervous system can prime the cortex, ultimately leading to improved neuroplasticity, motor recovery, and function. Improved outcomes are associated with increased excitability of the affected hemisphere. Interventions that focus on re-balancing the communication between both hemispheres are likely to lead to improved recovery. Priming is a technique used to enhance the brain’s ability to re-balance the 2 hemispheres following a stroke. Priming interventions include invasive and non-invasive techniques and can be administered prior to or during therapy.

 We sell only the very best epoxy!
 After reviewing & testing all leading epoxies, we found 820 epoxy to be the best. This is why we are proud to sell this outstanding product!
 We will continue to sell West System Epoxy (see below)
 Summary:
 - UV stable (all hardeners)
 - Room temp & high temp cure (handles temp up to 210F)
 - Post curing compatible
 - Very high tensile (breaking strength)
 - Low Viscosity (thinner epoxy)
 - Available in Qt, Gal, 5Gal, & 55Gal drums
 - Very low to no odor
 - a professional epoxy that works exceptionally well for pros and hobbyists alike
 The 820 Epoxy Laminating Systems are developed for the fabrication and repair of high performance composite structures. They consist of one resin and a selection of three separate hardeners to suit your building or repair needs. The resin and hardener combinations produce low viscosity mixtures with convenient volumetric mix ratios. In addition, the 820 Epoxy Laminating Systems are specially formulated for standard wet lay-up or resin-infusion operations requiring the highest degree of fabric wetting and air release attributes. The systems are specifically engineered to promote a high fiber-to-resin ratio and a greater interface with composite fabric(s), thereby resulting in lighter, stronger parts offering lower maintenance and long-term performance.
 820 Epoxy Laminating Systems are UV stabilized, ultra low viscosity laminating system that is ideal for use in vacuum infusion processes or RTM applications. Use with Graphite, S-Glass, E-Glass or Kevlar fabrics. Produces strong, light weight composite parts. They are specially formulated for standard wet lay-up or resin-infusion operations requiring the highest degree of fabric wetting and air release attributes.
 We recommend curing 820 & our Nanotube Enhanced Resin between 85F and 160F. We have not tested above 200F and temp below 80F are not recommended due to very long cure times. The 820 and our nano resin will get thick when they get cold. If stored below 60F it may become semi-solid (this does not hurt the resin); if this occurs, put the can in front of a space heater and the resin will become thin and clear again. If you need a resin to cure below 77F, we recommend you consider West Systems below.

Regimented cleanings will also reduce incidents of stains and discoloration on the block surface. The frequency in which blocks should be cleaned depends upon how harsh the environment is in your pool facility. For instance, indoor pools with poor air circulation may necessitate rinsing of starting platforms 1-2 times per week with tap water. This will ensure the removal of corrosive airborne contaminants that will inevitably land on the surface of your starting platforms.
 Starting platforms should always be dried with a soft cloth, with attention given to the welded portions of the platform and any areas where bolts are used to join pieces of metal together- these areas are most susceptible to crevice corrosion. Starting platforms in outdoor pool facilities require similar levels of care, and we recommend that all starting platforms be covered when not in use to limit surface abrasions and discourage unwanted play.
 Weekly Maintenance:
 3M Surfaces (Top, Wedge, and Step):
 Rinse with fresh tap water
 Use a plastic bristle scrub brush in a circular motion to gently remove dirt and stains
 Pat dry with a clean, soft cloth
 Starting Platform Frame
 Rinse with fresh tap water
 Dry with clean, soft cloth
 Monthly to Yearly Maintenance:
 3M Surfaces (Top, Wedge, and Step):
 Rinse with fresh tap water
 Use a non-abrasive, non-chemical based cleaner such as a mild dish detergent, a plastic scrub brush and non-chlorinated water to remove dirt and stains from the 3M surfaces.
 Starting Platform Stainless Steel Frame:
 Use Spectra Clean and 3m scratch pad to remove any rust stains
 Dry with a clean, soft cloth
 After thoroughly cleaning the stainless steel frame, apply Spectra Shield and let dry
 Apply WD-40 as necessary to wedge/rail bracket to help insure smooth wedge movement
 Starting Platform Powder Coated Frame:
 Use a non-abrasive soap and tap water. Avoid harsh chemicals and disinfectants
 Periodically check the structure for scratching or chips
 If rust is present, clean the surface with a non-abrasive cleaner and contact us to explore options to touch up the paint
 After thoroughly cleaning the starting platform frame, you can apply car wax and buff to a shine
 Apply WD-40 as necessary to wedge/rail bracket to help insure smooth wedge movement

 Key Takeaways
 MMDx is an accurate and reproducible measurement of the kidney biopsy.
 There is minimal inter-observer disagreement in MMDx reporting, in contrast to histopathology.
 There is significant disagreement between MMDx and histopathology, particularly in boundary states such as “borderline” for TCMR.
 MMDx can either be sent at the time of biopsy or preserved (frozen in RNAlater) for later reference.
 Summary Statement
 This study demonstrates the reproducibility of MMDx and the lack of significant disagreement between MMDx sign outs.
 The study describes in detail where MMDx and histopathology disagree. There is relatively good agreement between histological ABMR and MMDx, but MMDx diagnoses more ABMR than histology. Additionally, there is reasonable agreement in “no rejection” but there is very significant disagreement in TCMR and “borderline for TCMR.”
 Summary
 Diagnostic platforms require precision (reproducibility), accuracy (represent the true disease state), and standardization. Histology has well-described limitations.
 The Molecular Microscope Diagnostic System (MMDx) consists of an automated report combining rejection and injury-related scores with a graphic representation of the molecular position of the current biopsy, which is compared to a reference set, and a categorical sign-out by an expert or an algorithm (AutoMMDx).
 This study compared the results of 1679 indication biopsies from the 1120 INTERCOMEX trial subjects and compared various discrepancies: within MMDx; between MMDx sign-outs; and between MMD and histology.
 The results showed that MMDx outputs (rejection classifiers, etc.) are nearly identical between technical replicates, i.e., a biopsy core divided in two and processed separately gives a 99% correlation. Similarly, MMDx sign-outs between two experts and the automated algorithm were highly correlated. One comparison revealed 6% discrepancies, of which only 1.4% occurred in clear categories. Conversely, MMDx and histology sign-outs disagreed 37% of the time, broken down into 22% in ABMR, 61% in TCMR, and 24% in no rejection.
 The histology diagnosis of “borderline for TCMR” was rarely TCMR by MMDx (ABMR 24/128, no rejection 83/128, TCMR 9/128). 49% of MMDx diagnosed ABMR was not ABMR by histology, and although MMDx diagnosed similar numbers of TCMR as by histology, there was extensive disagreement. 68/123 MMDx diagnoses of TCMR were not reported as TCMR by histology. MMDx may offer particular value where pathology is ambiguous, i.e. borderline or suspicious.
 If not sending MMDx on all biopsies already, the authors recommend storing a 3mm section of biopsy core in RNA later for use in certain circumstances, such as where MMDx may add clarification:
 Where DSA are negative or unclear, and there is a suspicion of ABMR
 Where there is “Mixed” rejection
 In TCMR, Borderline TCMR and to rule out TCMR co-existing with BK
 It would also be sensible to utilize MMDx where patients are re-biopsied because the original biopsy was ambiguous or where the clinical course has not unfolded as expected.

 Key Takeaways
 The study describes the molecular landscape of antibody mediated rejection.
 Gene transcripts correlate with increasing ISHLT grade of rejection.
 Some milder forms of ABMR, e.g. pAMR 1(H), may share molecular features of full blown pAMR 2 with implications for management.
 Introduction
 Tissue-level molecular analysis of heart transplant biopsies with MMDx correlates with ISHLT grade of AMR but identifies important discrepancies. MMDx is a tool for personalized, precision diagnostics and is useful for designing and testing novel therapeutic interventions.
 Data Analysis
 In this study, Loupy and colleagues took 55 heart transplant patients with antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) and matched them with 55 patients without ABMR (with no rejection or with TCMR).
 ABMR was defined by two pathologists, who were blinded to clinical information and DSA status, according to the ISHLT 2013 classification (pAMR 0, pAMR 1(I), pAMR 1 (H), pAMR 2 and pAMR 3, where ‘I’ is immunological evidence of ABMR and ‘H’ is histological evidence of ABMR). A validation cohort confirmed the results.
 Clinical Utility
 The study shows that the molecular landscape of heart transplant ABMR is composed of:
 NK associated transcripts;
 Endothelial activation transcripts;
 Interferon-gamma inducible transcripts; and
 Monocyte-macrophage transcripts.
 The most significant pathways were related to interferon-gamma effects, followed by NK cell signaling, leukocyte adhesion, and Fc-gamma receptor-mediated phagocytosis by macrophages.
 There was a positive correlation between gene transcript expression and increasing ISHLT grade of ABMR.
 The gene transcripts also correlated with the presence of class I and class II donor-specific antibodies (DSA).
 Analysis shows that 12/20 cases of pAMR1 (I) are molecularly inactive (implying they are over-diagnosed by histology or would not need treatment). Whereas, 19/24 pAMR (H) cases were molecularly active similar to full-blown pAMR 2/3 (the implication being that although pAMR 1(H) is often not treated where molecular activity is demonstrated, they may be treated similar to pAMR 2/3).
 The authors conclude that tissue-level molecular analysis is useful for designing and testing novel therapeutic interventions and improving precision medicine.

When nickel is added to 300-series stainless steel, it provides better corrosion resistance, greater strength in high and low temperatures, and increased toughness in low temperatures. Nickel lowers the effects of work hardening, thus reducing traces of magnetism caused by cold forming and making material flow more freely in manufacturing.
 Capable of withstanding harsh and corrosive environments, these materials are often used in high-performance applications, particularly in the chemical processing and energy industries. It’s commonly used to build gas and steam turbines in power plants.
 United Titanium stocks a diverse assortment of nickel-based alloys and nickel chromium-based alloys including Alloy C-276, Alloy C-22, Alloy 600, Alloy 718 and more.

 SafetySpace Filter Tips have more space between the sample and the filter than do conventional filter tips. This virtually eliminates the risk of an expensive or a contagious sample permeating the filter.
 The safety space feature is particularly useful in pipetting foaming liquids such as buffers and proteins, pipetting solvents, multiple dispensing functions of electronic pipettes, reverse pipetting and any other application requiring extra space in the tip
 The tips are made of virgin polypropylene and the filter of polyethylene without ""self-sealing"" additives to avoid any interference with the sample and the results. The filter barrier helps protect against cross-contamination of the sample and/or the pipette and reduces the need for pipette maintenance. The filter tips are available in multiple volumes from 10 µl to 1200 µl and are packed in color coded single tray racks. They are DNase, RNase and endotoxin free certified and pre-sterilized.
 The filter barrier and the certified purity make the filter tips ideal for molecular biology, microbiology, cell culture applications and radioactive work.

 Corning Spin-X UF Concentrators
 Filters Centrifugal Filters
 Nonsterile centrifugal concentrators provide a simple, one-step procedure for concentrating or desalting proteins and other biomolecules with 90% or better recovery.
 Low binding polyethersulfone (PES) membranes are available with five molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO) to meet all concentration needs. Choose an MWCO ¹/₂ to ¹/₃ smaller than the protein to be concentrated. MWCO and graduations are printed on the side of the concentrator tube.
 The unique vertical membrane design and thin channel filtration chamber minimizes membrane fouling and provides fast, high-speed concentrating, even with particle-laden solutions. Integrated dead stop design reduces risk of spinning to dryness; no respinning necessary.
 Other applications include removal of labeled amino acids and nucleotides, HPLC sample preparation, deproteinization of samples, recovery of biomolecules from cell culture supernatants and lysates, and concentrating virus from cell culture supernatants.
 Ordering information: Spin-X UF 6 and 20 concentrators can be used with either the swinging bucket or fixed angle rotors. Spin-X UF 500 concentrators require fixed angle rotors. Spin-X UF 20 concentrators have a capacity of 14 ml if using fixed angle rotors.

They are constructed with Zeta Plus SP Series depth filtration media, composed of inorganic filter aid, cellulose and a resin system that imparts a positive charge to the filter matrix, aiding its adsorption of negatively charged contaminants.
 Pharmaceutical-grade filters that exhibit high contaminant-holding capacity and provide economical filtration and reliable particle reduction
 Retains contaminants by both mechanical entrapment and electrokinetic adsorption
 Zeta Plus SP Series filter cartridge media is offered in a full range of scalable capsule and cartridge filter configurations, enabling pilot testing and scale-up using the same materials as in full-scale systems
 Incorporating features of the standard Zeta Plus S Series filter cartridges, we manufacture the Zeta Plus SP Series filter cartridges to controls prescribed in 3M Purification's Drug Master Files on record with the FDA.
 Certificates of Quality are included with every filter. The Zeta Plus SP Series filter cartridges have complete lot-to-lot traceability and meet the requirements for USP Class VI Biological Reactivity Tests. Our family of Zeta Plus SP Series filter cartridges are composed of advanced cellulose-based depth filtration media, designed to retain contaminants by both mechanical entrapment and electrokinetic adsorption. Zeta Plus filter media is composed of high surface area filter aids embedded in a cellulose fiber matrix. During the manufacturing process, the resin system incorporated into the filter media imparts a positive charge to the filter matrix to permanently form an interconnected filtration structure with positively charged electrokinetic capture sites. The resulting porous depth filter is a complex network of charge-enhanced flow channels capable of removing bacteria, particulate, cellular debris and submicronic contaminants to a level which mechanical screening alone cannot achieve.
 Zeta Plus Construction: Our cartridges are constructed from individual cells of Zeta Plus SP Series filter media assembled together with polypropylene ring seals under predetermined compression and unitized by three, 316 stainless steel bands. Each cell is constructed using polypropylene molded edge seals and separators for high performance. Additional gasket material options are available.
 Zeta Plus SP Series filter media is available in a broad range of micron ratings to meet coarse, medium or fine clarification applications. Optimum flow rates vary by application, but in general, lower flux rates often result in longer service life, greater throughputs and superior system economics.
 Zeta Plus Scalability:
 We also offer a range of cartridge sizes, making scale-up easy and predictable, from laboratory scale to pilot plant, and from pilot plant to full production. Filter cartridges are available in 8"", 12"", and 16"" diameters, with surface areas ranging from 650 cm² to 3.9 m² (0.7 ft² to 42.2 ft²) per cartridge to make scale-up straight forward and predictable.

The U formulation is recommended for use with oils contaminated mainly with carbon particles, and the UW formulation is specifically formulated for use with oils contaminated with both carbon particles and moisture.
 Products developed specifically for the filtration of Insulation oil used in power generation
 Tight 10U and 10UW grades provide reduction of very fine particles
 Water absorbent formulation provides superior water reduction capabilities (UW Grade)
 Zeta Plus charge-modified filter media uses electrokinetic adsorption to remove contaminants and colloid materials smaller than those filtered by mechanical sieving alone.
 Zeta Plus U and UW Series filter cartridges are used for reconditioning insulating oils in power generation. Two grades of media, 05 and 10, are available: 05 grade provides efficient reduction of particle contaminants in most insulation oil applications, while the 10 grade provides efficient reduction of ultrafine particles.
 As oil specifications get tighter, finer filtration is required to meet those demands. The 10U formulation was developed to help reduce smaller contaminants such as fine carbon particulate.
 Water contaminates the dielectric oil either from the atmosphere or breakdown of the oil itself. Water contamination is usually accompanied by particulate contamination, which then increases both the filtration and water reduction workload. Zeta Plus U and UW series formulations help address both problems.
 The construction of Zeta Plus Series 05UW and 10UW cartridges allow it to plug on saturation with water, effectively shutting off flow. This feature is important for two reasons. First, it provides a clearly defined end-point to filter life. Second, the automatic shut-off helps prevent recontamination of the filtrate with water.
 User-Friendly Design
 Optional cartridge reduction baskets are available for manually or mechanically installing and removing cartridges.

 Motic K-Series Stereo Microscopes
 Microscopes
 Motic’s K Series of stereo microscopes expand on the benefits of a Common Main Objective [CMO] optical system by integrating a Plan Achromat objective to merge the benefit of a long working distance (110mm) with the optical clarity of a CMO system
 The K Series offers the highest modularity of Motic’s stereo microscopes. Choose from the K-400 series microscopes with a four-step magnification changer at 6x, 12x, 25x, and 50x ratios; the K-500 series microsopes with a five-step magnification changer at 6.4x, 10x, 16x, 25x, and 40x ratios; or the K-700 series microscopes that feature a zoom range at 1:5.2 ratio designed on self-centering dovetail ring mechanism, total parfocality, and absolute centering. Various contrast methods offer endless expandability of the K Series without the need for purchasing a new microscope or modification. One problem can be examined in two to three different methods with one microscope, without the extra space required for additional microscopes. The K Series is compatible with a variety of stands, including ball bearing and articulated boom stands, to give the most flexibility in operation. Finally, the large array of accessories such as the Discussion/Teaching System (DSK) or drawing attachment allow for seemingly endless upgradability. Whatever the need, this stereo microscope series can be easily configured and adapted to the application needs and working environment.
 Images on the edge of the field of view appear flat instead of curved, as in other systems, which makes the K series ideal for inspection and photomicrography among other applications. Further enhancing the image's details and quality is the built-in double iris diaphragm of the optical bridge, which compensates for oversaturation of the illumination or the reflectiveness of the sample.
 Ordering information: Microscope is supplied with all accessories listed above. Contact your VWR representative to learn more about this and other Motic solutions. All Motic products come with a one-year electrical and five-year mechanical warranty.

 PCR sequencing kits enable the preparation of genomic DNA for nanopore sequencing from as little as 100 ng DNA using PCR.
 Low input amounts — as little as 100 ng DNA
 High sequencing yields
 Control over read length
 Multiplex 12 samples with the PCR Barcoding Kit
 The PCR Sequencing Kit and PCR Barcoding Kit are designed to prepare sequencing libraries when there is a limited amount of starting gDNA available.
 The gDNA is fragmented in a Covaris g-TUBE. The sheared ends are repaired and dA-tailed using the NEBNext End Repair/dA-tailing module, and then adapters which contain primer binding sites are ligated onto the prepared ends. An amplification step follows using primers that contain 5' tags which facilitate the ligase-free attachment of Rapid Sequencing Adapters.
 The kits involve approximately 50 minutes of pre-PCR work. The PCR step is variable (depends on the number of cycles, polymerase speed and template length). The standard protocol suggests starting with 100 ng of gDNA: less can be used, but it may be necessary to increase the number of PCR cycles. The post-PCR work takes approximately 10 minutes.
 The fragment length produced after PCR is dependent on the length of the material input into the PCR and is limited by the processivity of the DNA polymerase. This means that superior fragment lengths can be achieved with the PCR Sequencing Kit or PCR Barcoding Kit, compared to the Rapid PCR Barcoding Kit, which is limited to 2 kb. Therefore these kits offer a solution to those who have limited amounts of starting material (i.e. need to do PCR) but require longer reads than are offered by the Rapid PCR Barcoding Kit.
 These kits also offer a method whereby users are able to tag their own specific amplicons with the same 5' group, simplifying downstream post-PCR processing. This is done via a four-primer PCR. Users add a 5' tail to their own primer sequences and this acts a priming site for a set of generic 'outer' primers (supplied with the kits) and these primers contain the 5' tags which facilitate the ligase-free attachment of Rapid Sequencing Adapters.
 Barcoding or multiplexing is useful when the amount of data required per sample is less than the total amount of data that can be generated from a single flow cell: it allows a user to pool multiple samples and sequence them together, making more efficient use of the flow cell.
 The PCR Barcoding Kit is designed to prepare barcoded sequencing libraries when there is a limited amount of starting gDNA available from multiple samples. The kit contains 12 primer pairs, which are used to amplify each sample: each primer pair contains a barcode and 5' tags which facilitate the ligase-free attachment of Rapid Sequencing Adapters. Amplified and barcoded samples are then pooled together and Rapid Sequencing Adapters are added to the pooled mix. Deconvolution of barcoded sequencing data is supported by the MinKNOW and Guppy software provided with MinION sequencing devices, which classify the barcode sequence and sort reads into corresponding folders.
 Sample multiplexing for the PCR Barcoding Kit is 12.
 Delivery information: Flow cells and kits are shipped together at 2 to 8 C. Upon receipt, please place the product in a long-term storage location at ‒20 C. Oxford Nanopore Technologies deem the useful life of the product to be three months from receipt by the customer.

 Pipets Pipet Controllers
 The ergonomic design of Pipet Pump III Pipettors enhances comfort, utility, and dispensing precision while helping to reduce the risk of injury from repetitive and awkward pipetting motions.
 Ergonomic design minimizes user strain
 Lightweight, one-handed operation
 Thumb wheel is used to 'blow out' contents of the pipet
 The angle of the inserted pipet and its placement in front of the hand allows the arm to remain in a more natural, lowered position unlike other pipettors, which require arm and elbow elevation for many pipetting actions.
 A fast-release trigger dispenses the entire pipet contents while an optimally located thumb wheel easily rotates for precision aspirating or dispensing. Volumes as low as one drop at a time may be set, all while using a relaxed grip. The thumb wheel also can be used to 'blow out' the contents of the pipet.
 Available in three different pipet volumes (2, 10 and 25 ml), each color-coded for easy identification. A self-stabilizing collar inside the silicone chuck holds either glass or plastic pipets. Resistant to acids, alkalis, and most solvents, the device can be disassembled for cleaning.
 Compact design adds only 15.2 cm (6"") to the pipet length, allowing use in fume hoods and controlled environment glove boxes.

 Digital refractometers offer automatic measurement of the refractive index and Brix scale.
 Model RX-007[alpha] is designed for measuring water soluble samples with very low concentrations (5% or less), such as tea and low sugar beverages. It has a measurement temperature of 15 to 30C (59 to 86F). Models RX-5000[alpha], RX-7000[alpha], and RX-9000[alpha] are equipped with a Peltier thermo module for maintaining a constant measuring temperature. Measurement starts after the sample reaches the target temperature. Up to 30 user scales can be programmed on these models, and they also feature flash memory, which is capable of recalling the last 30 measured values. Model RX-5000[alpha] has a measurement temperature of 5 to 60C (41 to 140F). Model RX-7000[alpha] has wider measurement ranges than model RX-5000[alpha] and is suited for measuring samples that have a higher melting point, such as oils and fats, and samples that have a higher refractive index, such as perfumes and organic solvents. Model RX-7000[alpha] has a measurement temperature of 5 to 70C (41 to 158F).
 Model RX-9000[alpha] offers the highest level of accuracy in all measurement ranges, and is suitable for a wide range of sample types, such as oils and fats with high melting points, aroma oils of high refractive index, and organic solvents. It has a measurement temperature of 5 to 70C (41 to 158F). Model RX-5000[alpha]-Bev is a re-designed version of model RX-5000[alpha], and is suitable for measuring beverages. A flat sample stage replaced the sample well to make it easier to wipe off the samples and to allow for faster and easier clean-up. Model RX-5000 is equipped with all standard features of RX-[alpha] series except built-in thermostatic module. Instead of that it includes nozzle for connection to a external water bath.
 All models have a printer output, as well as a RS-232C output for connection to a computer.
 Optional digital printer units automatically print out the number of samples, measurement value for refractive index (nD or nDt), Brix (%), concentration (%), and measurement temperature whenever the refractometer completes measurement. Model DP-RX is a thermal dot printer suitable for use with RX-7000[alpha] (serial no. 051301 onward). Model DP-RD is an impact dot printer suitable for use with all RX-[alpha] series refractometers.
 Ordering information: Supplied with a one-year manufacturer’s warranty. A calibration certificate is available for each unit. Contact your VWR representative for information. Given accuracy is based on measurement of sucrose solution.

 The Refracto 30PX has an optical glass prism held by a stainless steel ring. The Refracto 30GS has a sapphire prism held by a ring of hard gold-plated brass. Sapphire has a higher refractive index and better thermal conductivity than glass. For this reason, the Refracto 30GS has an extended measuring range and registers sample temperature more quickly.
 Simply place a drop of sample directly onto the prism or immerse the sensor in the sample. Temperature compensation coefficient is programmable for up to ten different samples. Units can store up to 1,100 measurement results that can be transmitted to an external printer or computer via infrared interface (PC software included). Backlit LCD displays temperature selection in C or F. Calibration is automatic and based on deionized water. Units of measurement include refractive index (nD), nD temperature compensated, % Brix, HFCS42, HFCS55, T.A. 1990, KMW (Babo), Baumé, Oechsle (D, CH), w/w% and v/v% for isopropanol, and user-defined units.
 Ordering information: Refracto refractometers are delivered in the PortableLab, a case complete with two pipets for sample handling, two flasks for samples and cleaning solutions, five cleaning tissues, operating instructions, a CD-ROM with data transmission software, a tutorial, and two 1.5V AAA batteries.

 CTC/LEAP Technologies GC Autosampler Syringes, Hamilton
 Syringes Syringes for Chromatography
 The Hamilton C-Line syringe minimizes the potential for bent needles with a keyed flange design.
 C-Line syringes incorporate several unique design features that ensure superior performance
 An improperly installed syringe can cause mis-injections or bent needles due to poor alignment. The unique flange alignment design aids in installation and results in fewer bent needles while the plunger button can be adjusted to prevent plunger tip damage. An innovative direct attachment design of the needle to the barrel minimizes sample carryover. Hamilton's headspace syringe is specifically designed for the CTC CombiPAL GC autosampler system. The High Dynamic (HD) plunger has been optimized for higher throughput in headspace techniques. These syringes feature a new sealing system based on a novel metal spring allows working with enhanced tightness, excellent performance over a large temperature range and temperature gradients, increased lifetime compared to traditional headspace syringes and ncreased accuracy and reproducibility of headspace GC analysis.
 Syringes in this category are either 700 and 7000 series Microliter or 1700 and 1000 series Gastight syringes. Microliter syringes have a stainless steel plunger that is hand fitted to the glass barrel and are designed for liquid sampling. Gastight syringes have a PTFE plunger tip that creates tight connection between the syringe barrel and plunger allowing for liquid or gas sampling.
 Compatibility: The latest generation of Hamilton autosampler syringes is recommended by CTC for use in the popular GC PAL systems: PAL GC-xt, PAL COMBI-xt, PAL COMBI-xt extended.
 C-Line Syringe Terminations: Cemented Needle (N)- For low volume syringes, the needles are cemented into the glass syringe barrel at a point corresponding to the zero graduation mark. With this termination, dead volume is limited to the internal volume of the needle. Not autoclavable. Needle gauge is determined by the syringe volume and is not user-selectable.
 Special Cemented Needle (SN) - Shares the same characteristics as a standard cemented needle syringe but comes in a special length.
 Knurled Hub (KH)- Removable plunger/needle assembly, knurled hub is used exclusively on the 7000 series syringes.
 Headspace Syringe Terminations: Luer Tip Cemented Needle (LTN)- For mid volume syringes the needles are cemented into the glass syringe barrel at a point corresponding to the zero graduation mark. With this termination, dead volume is limited to the internal volume of the needle. Not autoclavable. Needle gauge is determined by the syringe volume and are not user-selectable.
 Needle Point Styles: Point Style 2 - Sharp, beveled, curved, non-coring needle point recommended for septum penetration.
 Point Style 3 - Blunt needle point for use with HPLC injection valves and for sample pipetting.
 Point Style 4 - Standard 12 beveled needle point is recommended for life science applications. Special point styles such as 45 or any other angle are available upon request.

 Gastight 1700 Series Syringes, Hamilton
 Syringes Syringes for Chromatography
 These syringes are the Gastight version of the original 700 series syringes and are ideal for dispensing volumes from 1μL up to 500μL.
 Gastight syringes are ideal for dispensing both liquids and gases and have a precision-machined PTFE plunger tip which creates a leak-free seal
 Cemented needles for low volume syringes are cemented into the glass syringe barrel at a point corresponding to the zero graduation mark. With this termination, dead volume is limited to the internal volume of the needle. Not autoclavable. Needle gauge is determined by the syringe volume and are not user-selectable. Removable needles are a Hamilton-specific design. The design allows the needles to seat precisely at the zero graduation mark of the syringe. Users can select the needle gauge, length, and point style to optimize the syringe for custom applications. This termination allows for a removable needle without increasing the dead volume of the syringe and is ideal when there is a risk of the needle clogging. Autoclavable when disassembled. Repeated autoclaving will shorten syringe life. Luer tip needles are removable and fit over a ground glass hub which is tapered in the shape of a male luer. This termination will accept most hypodermic needles but was designed specifically for use with Hamilton Kel-F needles. This termination also increases the dead volume in the syringe, which may not be appropriate for some applications. Autoclavable to 115C when disassembled.
 PTFE luer lock termination has a PTFE, male Luer taper with nickelplated brass locking hub for use with Kel-F needles, metal hub needles, and universal connectors. It is also used with Hamilton diluters/dispensers, OEM applications, and manual operations. The version with slots is used during the attachment to some instruments but does not effect the connection to needles. Not autoclavable (25mL and greater syringes).
 Needle Point Styles: Point style 2 is a sharp, beveled, curved, non-coring needle point recommended for septum penetration. Point style 3 is a blunt needle point for use with HPLC injection valves and for sample pipetting. Point style 5 is a conical needle with side port for penetration of septa, thin-gauged vinyls and plastics without coring.

 Syringes Syringes for Chromatography
 The 600 series syringes are a rugged, durable, and long lasting half-stroke version of the original 700 series syringes
 Needles are removable and are a Hamilton-specific design. The design allows the needles to seat precisely at the zero graduation mark of the syringe. This termination also allows for a removable needle without increasing the dead volume of the syringe and is ideal when there is a risk of the needle clogging. Autoclavable when disassembled. Gas sterilizable. Repeated autoclaving will shorten syringe life.
 Needle Point Style:
 Point style 3 is a blunt needle point for use with HPLC injection valves and for sample pipetting.
 They have a reinforced plunger which prevents plunger bending. Each plunger is individually fitted to the glass barrel and cannot be interchanged between syringes. This series of syringes is ideal for dispensing volumes from 0.25μL up to 5μL. The 600 series is often used in applications that require one-handed operation because of the short stroke length and the reinforced plunger. Fluid path includes SST and borosilicate glass.

 Syringes Syringes, Medical
 Sklar's Pomery Ear Syringe is a three finger ring, ENT instrument used for irrigation and cleaning of the ear canal
 The syringe is filled with body temperature water or other irrigation solution which is then injected into the ear canal. The flow and force of the solution losens and flushes out cerumen and debris. Two different tips are available for this syringe. One is bulbous and does not enter the ear canal deeply, whereas the other is conical and can enter further into the canal. The size and shape of the patient's ear, along with user preference, will determine which type of tip is utilized.
