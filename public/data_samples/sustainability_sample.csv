The Court Finds No Evidence of Fraud on the Board Plaintiffs argued that entire fairness review was still warranted because Ellison and Catz allegedly defrauded the Board by failing to disclose their beliefs about NetSuite to the Special Committee and other discussions about NetSuite’s post-merger management. [5] The Court likewise rejected Plaintiffs’ allegations that Ellison applied control through Catz due to a lack of evidence demonstrating such control—including that the Special Committee, and not Catz, ran the negotiation process, and that Catz (as Ellison’s purported surrogate) “did not take actions to advance Ellisons interests.” Second, Plaintiffs alleged that Ellison and current CEO Safra Catz misled the Board and the Special Committee, rendering the NetSuite acquisition a product of fraud.",https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2023/07/03/chancery-court-finds-for-oracle-founder-and-ceo-in-post-trial-decision/,Governance,Bad health effect on customer or immoral behavior,0.0,0.87,2023-07-03T13:53:11Z

Now, with AWS having both a superior product and offering a lower TCO because of its Graviton processors for its public cloud, it does not necessarily need to provide the same level of discounts as Oracle in the cloud price war. AWS Relies on Lower TCO and Product StrengthOn the other hand, while not having Oracle’s huge on-prem customer base, AWS has been active in hybrid cloud mainly thanks to its long-standing agreement with VMware (VMW), towards whom Oracle showed hostility for a long time. For this purpose, I focus on AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute) cloud and database components, to show that it is Amazon that is emerging as the strongest contender in what was previously regarded as one of Oracle's key strengths. This could indeed be the case given that recession risks have gone higher and it is precisely here that vertically integrated cloud computing offerings like AWS can help organizations opt for elastic and scalable solutions or a more sustainable alternative than Oracle's relatively temporary product discounts.",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4567646-amazons-aws-growth-strategy-is-probably-more-sustainable-than-oracles?source=feed_all_articles,Environmental,Transition Risks,0.0,0.89,2023-01-03T23:42:05Z

Five years ago, three dozen former employees of Palo Alto computer-hardware firm HP and software giant Hewlett-Packard Enterprise — which moved its headquarters from San Jose to Houston this year — claimed in a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in San Jose that they were fired because the companies wanted younger workers. Mark Bauer worked at Oracle for 23 years as a technical writer, manager and director before he allegedly fell victim to the company’s “ageist culture” and was terminated in 2020 at age 66, he said in the suit filed Tuesday in San Francisco County Superior Court. Intel, after the commission’s finding, denied discriminating against older employees, telling The Oregonian that the layoffs were “based solely upon business needs.”Mountain View digital-advertising titan Google in 2019 settled for $11 million a long-running class-action lawsuit that accused it of discriminating against hundreds of older workers by failing to hire them because of their age. The company has consistently denied it discriminates on the basis of age, and said in a filing in U.S. District Court in San Jose that its actions regarding the two lead plaintiffs “were motivated by reasonable factors other than age.”",https://www.mercedsunstar.com/news/business/article270575227.html,Social,Worker rights,-1.0,0.84,2022-12-30T02:47:25Z

Our air-cooled chillers come with economizers that allow us to leverage colder temperatures to reject heat from our chilled water more efficiently – while eliminating the need for makeup water sources to maintain operation.”  While limiting the effects of extreme heat on vital data centre equipment, this technology is also good for the environment. “ In contrast, cloud providers are more inclined to push their infrastructure closer to the limits and have less margin for error during extreme weather events.”  How to protect data centres from heat waves  As heat waves become more common and catastrophic for global technology infrastructure, data centre operators must shore up their defences against this very real threat. CyrusOne, a provider of global data centres, has responded to extreme heat with closed-loop chilled water systems and air-cooled chillers. “A pump in this example is a water pump that circulates facility water (in a chilled water system) around the data centre as a coolant (cooled by the compressors in the water chillers) to remove heat from computer room air handlers, in-row cooling units, and other heat exchange units.",https://it.einnews.com/article/607810217,Environmental,Transition Risks,-1.0,1.0,2022-12-23T05:51:19Z

Research by the BSB relating to students enrolled on the BPTC (the old vocational stage of training for the Bar) from 2011-12 to 2019-20, shows that 77% of White candidates with a first-class degree and an ‘outstanding’ BPTC grade secured pupillage, compared with 65% of candidates from an ethnic minority background with the same grades.  In addition, a Bar Council Race at the Bar report published in November 2021 concluded that candidates from ethnic minority backgrounds are less likely to obtain pupillage than candidates from White backgrounds, even when controlling educational attainment such as university ranking, BPTC grade and degree class.  This research suggests that even when ethnic minorities have the same academic credentials as their White counterparts, they are still at a disadvantage in securing pupillage, and might find it more difficult to become a human rights barrister. But if you firmly believe that practising as a human rights barrister is what you want, asking yourself the following questions could help you to determine your chances of success:  Compared to your peers at school and university, are your academic grades among the best?",https://www.lawcareers.net/Explore/Oracle/07062022-How-do-I-become-a-human-rights-barrister,Governance,Diversity,0.0,0.84,2022-06-08T16:57:10Z

IoT service offeringsThe system will also give the telco the flexibility to optimise network and subscriber resources to launch 5G-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) service offerings to consumer and enterprise customers.In addition, leveraging Oracle’s built-in analytics function and support for edge-routing, BT will be able to make intelligent policy decisions using subscriber, class of service, quality of service and network resource data in real-time, to “deliver the best, most reliable experience for customers”, the partners said.Howard Watson, chief technology officer at BT, says, “As we move to this next evolution in networking, Oracle is helping us reduce complexity with solutions that ease the migration to 5G and provide the flexibility needed, both to introduce innovative new services and ensure we’re offering our customers the right levels of service according to their needs.” With a unified, future-ready policy management platform, BT can optimise network resources appropriately and bring new, innovative services and experiences to customers quicker.” EquinixBT isn’t the only one moving things forward in 5G monetisation either, with global data centre player Equinix getting into bed with Nokia to improve matters for the industry.Equinix has built a fully functional 5G and edge technology development centre, which includes a non-standalone 5G network from Nokia to support its drive for new wireless-related business through its telco customers.Used to test and validate various 5G services and use cases, Equinix says the development centre will help service providers and network operators bring “innovative concepts” to market, through providing an agile production framework for assessing, incubating and testing 5G and edge solutions for end-to-end and secure applications.Texas callingThe new 5G and Edge Technology Development Center, which is located at the Equinix DA11 International Business Exchange data centre in Dallas, Texas, is bringing together various telco ecosystem participants through a production-ready interconnection sandbox environment, from the radio network to the cloud.The development centre will initially focus on mobile hybrid multi-cloud connectivity, network slicing, distributed artificial intelligence and machine learning, enablement and orchestration of infrastructure, augmented and virtual reality, and gaming.Software-defined connectivityTo test their solutions, telcos can establish data centre-to-data centre network connections on-demand between any two Equinix Fabric site locations within a metro or globally via software-defined interconnections. And after dipping in briefly to the Series myself, I can testify that most attendees will learn something helpful, particularly those wanting to jump onto the “telco to techco” bandwagon.TechcoA techco is a telecoms provider that wants to build a meaningful ecosystem of partners that will help it break through the network silos it has been operating behind for the last 20-25 years, to reach and financially benefit from the new services being delivered through the likes of 5G and IoT.Any telco that doesn’t want to be a techco will probably not be around for much longer.The event is expected to attract over 10,500 attendees.",https://www.vanillaplus.com/2021/09/27/63877-telco-ecosystem-puts-flesh-on-the-bones-of-5g-monetisation/,Environmental,Carbon Footprint,1.0,0.98,2021-09-27T12:17:06Z

To effectively manage the end-to-end lifecycle of so many identities, these institutions need a solution that can both support their capacity today and scale exponentially in 10 years time.A good identity management process should also work around an institution’s budget and cloud strategy. This allows flexibility to authenticate across the entire ecosystem and reduces the need to purchase disparate systems.RELATED: Choosing an identity and access management solution for higher education.Give Remote Students Easy AccessIn today’s environment, most students are no longer able to go to the IT bar on campus to get support when they lock themselves out of their account. Now that we are remote and hybrid, institutions have to have complementary self-service platforms and cloud-based platforms that meet students’ needs wherever they are, even if they’re thousands of miles away from campus.Connecting disparate systems also allows colleges and universities to provision new credentials much more quickly and speed up the process of onboarding new students significantly. Student systems are then unified behind a single identity, so students don’t have to worry about remembering multiple login credentials.Centralize Identity Management to Support ComplianceThe University of Colorado is a great example of a school that decided to centralize its system for identity functions, recognizing a need for greater simplicity and compliance.When the university did not have a centralized system or process for its identity management, its IT office struggled to maintain processes across its CU Denver and Anschutz Medical campuses.",https://edtechmagazine.com/higher/article/2021/09/how-higher-ed-can-streamline-identity-management,Governance,Bad health effect on customer or immoral behavior,1.0,0.78,2021-09-08T17:47:20Z

The PledgeTo address the issues, the signatories have pledged to:Take steps to address emissions from their IT operations by, for instance: optimizing their systems to reduce data processing volumes; using cloud-based services where possible; and extending service life of devices by refurbishing existing assets instead of buying replacements.Set robust emissions targets for their IT operations and publicly disclose progress against them.Set rigorous sustainability standards for suppliers while supporting Canada’s cleantech industry.Promote the adoption of sustainable IT practices and consider areas where national standards for sustainable IT could help.These commitments will also enhance many of the signatories’ existing promises to become carbon-0. “We are proud to add Microsoft Canada to the CIO Strategy Council Sustainable IT Pledge, adding to our continued leadership when it comes to driving down emissions in the sector,” said John Weigelt, national technology officer, Microsoft Canada. Through this pledge, the work of the CIO Strategy Council and our collective efforts, together we can play a part in helping to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all.”",https://channeldailynews.com/news/cio-strategy-council-launches-sustainable-it-pledge/74755,Environmental,Carbon Footprint,1.0,0.95,2021-08-17T15:30:32Z

0300f3c6-93e5-11eb-a746-fdabd18be9c6,News,Building A Vibrant Partner Ecosystem: Taking A Page From The Salesforce Playbook,"Companies like Microsoft, Oracle and SAP have spent billions over the years building out their channel programs and partner ecosystems, relying on consultancies, integrators and VARs to drive their products deeper into the enterprise and create customer stickiness. However, as many of the more mature cloud platform players like Google, Salesforce and ServiceNow can attest, as a vendor moves further up in the enterprise and becomes a more critical component of the IT “stack,” a service partner ecosystem becomes more important.The fact is, larger enterprises have more complicated wants and needs, especially multinational or regulated companies. Partners play a huge role in the company’s flywheel of growth — from sourcing and selling deals, to the implementation and integration services that set customers up for success, to the training and managed services that keep them happy and coming back for more.Partners are also responsible for increasing the value of the Salesforce platform, creating apps that both use and extend Salesforce, especially into specific vertical markets that the ISV can’t address fully. It’s a playbook that many other vendors are following, especially as former Salesforce executives spread out across other cloud vendors, bringing Salesforce’s customer- and partner-focused DNA into these new companies.Create a platform that lures developersSalesforce certainly wasn’t the first company to build a platform for developers, butForce.com was the first cloud platform that allowed third-party developers to take advantage of a proven, multitenant, shared architecture. This one isn’t unique to Salesforce — many other companies offer early access to select partners — but given Salesforce’s pace of innovation and acquisitive nature, it’s taken early access programs (and the processes around them) to a whole new level.Invest in and celebrate the peoplePeople are the heart and soul of any business, but especially in professional services.",https://about.crunchbase.com/blog/building-a-vibrant-partner-ecosystem-taking-a-page-from-the-salesforce-playbook/,Environmental,Transition Risks,1.0,0.53,2021-08-10T07:04:13Z
